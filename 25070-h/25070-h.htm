 /><span>&nbsp;hope</span> your passenger
hasn&#8217;t missed his
train,&rdquo; observed the ferryman
to Mr. Jimmy
Fallows, who sat on the
river bank with the
painter of his rickety little naphtha
launch held loosely in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Opp?&rdquo; said Jimmy. &ldquo;I bet he
did. If there is one person in the world
that&#8217;s got a talent for missing things,
it&#8217;s Mr. Opp. I never seen him that he
hadn&#8217;t just missed gettin&#8217; a thousand
dollar job, or inventin&#8217; a patent, or bein&#8217;
hurt when he had took out a accident
policy. If he did ketch a train, like
enough it was goin&#8217; the wrong way.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.009" id="png.009"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">4</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Jimmy had been waiting since nine in
the morning, and it was now well past
noon. He was a placid gentleman of
curvilinear type, short of limb and large
of girth. His trousers, of that morose
hue termed by the country people
&ldquo;plum,&rdquo; reached to his armpits, and his
hat, large and felt and weather-beaten,
was only prevented from eclipsing his
head by the stubborn resistance of two
small, knob-like ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Opp ain&#8217;t been back to the Cove
for a long while, has he?&rdquo; asked the ferryman,
whose intellectual life depended
solely upon the crumbs of information
scattered by chance passers-by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goin&#8217; on two years,&rdquo; said Mr. Fallows.
&ldquo;Reckon he&#8217;s been so busy formin&#8217;
trusts and buyin&#8217; out railways and
promotin&#8217; things generally that he ain&#8217;t
had any time to come back home. It&#8217;s
his step-pa&#8217;s funeral that&#8217;s bringin&#8217;
him now. The only time city folks seem
to want to see their kin folks in the country
is when they are dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&#8217;t that him a-comin&#8217; down the
<a name="png.010" id="png.010"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">5</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>bank?&rdquo; asked the ferryman, shading his
eyes with his hands.</p>

<p>Mr. Fallows, with some difficulty, got
to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&#8217;s him all right. Hustlin&#8217;
to beat the band. Wonder if he takes me
for a street car.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coming with important stride down
the wharf, and whistling as he came, was
a small man of about thirty-five. In one
hand he carried a large suit-case, and in
the other a new and shining grip. On
both were painted, in letters designed to
be seen, &ldquo;D.&nbsp;Webster Opp, Kentucky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In fact, everything about him was evidently
designed to be seen. His new suit
of insistent plaid, his magnificent tie sagging
with the weight of a colossal scarf-pin,
his brown hat, his new tan shoes, all
demanded individual and instant attention.</p>

<p>The only insignificant thing about Mr.
Opp was himself. His slight, undeveloped
body seemed to be in a chronic state
of apology for failing properly to set off
the glorious raiment wherewith it was
<a name="png.011" id="png.011"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">6</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>clothed. His pock-marked face, wide at
the temples, sloped to a small, pointed
chin, which, in turn, sloped precipitously
into a long, thin neck. It was Mr. Opp&#8217;s
eyes, however, that one saw first, for
they were singularly vivid, with an expression
that made strangers sometimes
pause in the street to ask him if he had
spoken to them. Small, pale, and red of
rim, they nevertheless held the look of
intense hunger&mdash;hunger for the hope or
the happiness of the passing moment.</p>

<p>As he came bustling down to the
water&#8217;s-edge he held out a friendly hand
to Jimmy Fallows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you, Jimmy?&rdquo; he said in a
voice freighted with importance. &ldquo;Hope
I haven&#8217;t kept you waiting long. Several
matters of business come up at the
last and final moment, and I missed the
morning train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jimmy, who was pouring gasolene
into a tank in the launch, treated the
ferryman to a prodigious wink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, not more&#8217;n four or five hour,&rdquo;
he said, casting side glances of mingled
<a name="png.012" id="png.012"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">7</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>scorn and admiration at Mr. Opp&#8217;s attire.
&ldquo;It is a good thing it was the
funeral you was tryin&#8217; to get to instid
of the death-bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that reminds me,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp,
suddenly exchanging his air of cheerfulness
for one of becoming gravity&mdash;&ldquo;what
time is the funeral obsequies
going to take place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whenever we git there,&rdquo; said
Jimmy, pushing off the launch and waving
his hand to the ferryman. &ldquo;You&#8217;re
one of the chief mourners, and I&#8217;m the
undertaker; there ain&#8217;t much danger in
us gettin&#8217; left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp deposited his baggage carefully
on the seat, and spread his coat
across the new grip to keep it from getting
splashed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long was Mr. Moore sick?&rdquo; he
asked, fanning himself with his hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jimmy, &ldquo;he was in a
dangerous and critical condition for
about twenty-one years, accordin&#8217; to his
own account. I been seein&#8217; him durin&#8217;
that time on a average of four times a
<a name="png.013" id="png.013"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">8</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>day, and last night when I seen him in
his coffin it was the first time the old
gentleman failed to ask me to give him a
drink on account of his poor health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Ben there?&rdquo; asked Mr. Opp, studying
a time-table, and making a note in his
memorandum-book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your brother Ben? Yes; he come
this mornin&#8217; just before I left. He was
cussin&#8217; considerable because you wasn&#8217;t
there, so&#8217;s they could go on and git
through. He wants to start back to Missouri
to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he out at the house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; he&#8217;s at Your Hotel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp looked up in surprise, and
Jimmy chuckled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That there&#8217;s the name of my new
hotel. Started up sence you went away.
Me and old man Tucker been running
boardin&#8217;-houses side by side all these
years. What did he do last summer but
go out and git him a sign as big as the
side of the house, and git Nick Fenny to
paint &lsquo;Our Hotel&rsquo; on it; then he put it
up right across the sidewalk, from the
<a name="png.014" id="png.014"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">9</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>gate clean out to the road. I didn&#8217;t say
nothin&#8217;, but let the boys keep on a-kiddin&#8217;
me till the next day; then I got me
a sign jus&#8217; like his, with &lsquo;Your Hotel&rsquo; on
it, and put it up crost my sidewalk.
He&#8217;d give a pretty if they was both
down now; but he won&#8217;t take his down
while mine is up, and I ain&#8217;t got no
notion of taking it down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, absently, for his
mind was still on the time-table; &ldquo;I see
that there&#8217;s an accommodation that departs
out of Coreyville in the neighborhood
of noon to-morrow. It&#8217;s a little
unconvenient, I&#8217;m afraid, but do you
think you could get me back in time to
take it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what&#8217;s yer hurry?&rdquo; asked
Jimmy, steering for mid-stream. &ldquo;I
thought you&#8217;d come to visit a spell, with
all them bags and things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp carelessly tossed back the
sleeve of the coat, to display more fully
the name on the suit-case. &ldquo;Them&#8217;s
drummers&#8217; samples,&rdquo; he said almost
reverently&mdash;&ldquo;the finest line of shoes that
<a name="png.015" id="png.015"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">10</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>have ever been put out by any house in
the United States, bar none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought you was in the insurance
business,&rdquo; said Jimmy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; that was last year, just previous
to my reporting on a newspaper.
This&rdquo;&mdash;and Mr. Opp tried to spread out
his hands, but was slightly deterred by
the size of his cuffs&mdash;&ldquo;this is the chance
I been looking for all my life. It takes
brains and a&#8217; educated nerve, and a
knowledge of the world. I ought to
create considerable capital in the next
few years. And just as soon as I do&rdquo;&mdash;and
Mr. Opp leaned earnestly toward
Jimmy, and tapped one finger upon the
palm of his other hand&mdash;&ldquo;just as soon
as I do, I intend to buy up all the land
lying between Turtle Creek and the
river. There&#8217;s enough oil under that
there ground to ca&#8217;m the troubled
waters of the Pacific Ocean. You remember
old Mr. Beeker? Well, he told
me, ten years ago, that he bored a well
for brine over there, and it got so full of
black petroleum he had to abandon it.
<a name="png.016" id="png.016"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">11</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Now, I&#8217;m calculating on forming a stock
company,&mdash;you and Mr. Tucker, I and
old man Hager, and one or two others,&mdash;and
buying up that ground. Then we&#8217;ll
sink a test well, get up a derrick and a&#8217;
engine, and have the thing running in no
time. The main thing is a competent
manager. You know I&#8217;m thinking
seriously of taking it myself? It&#8217;s too
big a proposition to run any risks with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, say, wait a minute; how long
have you had this here shoe job?&rdquo;
Jimmy caught madly at the first fact in
sight to keep him from being swept away
by the flood of Mr. Opp&#8217;s oily possibilities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I taken it last week,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp;
&ldquo;had to go all the way to Chicago to get
my instructions, and to get fitted out.
My territory is a specially important
one; four counties, all round Chicago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was in Chicago oncet,&rdquo; said
Jimmy, his eyes brightening at the memory.
&ldquo;By golly! if the world is as big in
every direction as it is in that, she&#8217;s a
whopper!&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.017" id="png.017"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">12</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The wind, freshening as they got
under way, loosened the canvas overhead,
and Mr. Opp rose to buckle it into
place. As he half knelt in the bow of the
boat, he lifted his face to the cool breeze,
and took a deep breath of satisfaction.
The prosaic river from Coreyville to the
Cove was the highway he knew best in
the world. Under the summer sunshine
the yellow waters lost their sullen hue,
and reflected patches of vivid red and
white from the cottages and barns that
dotted the distant shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t consider there&#8217;s any sceneries
in the country that&#8217;ll even begin to
compare with these here,&rdquo; Mr. Opp announced,
out of the depths of his wide
experience. &ldquo;Just look at the sunshine
pouring forth around the point of the
island. It spills through the trees and
leaks out over the water just like quicksilver.
Now, that&#8217;s a good thought!
It&#8217;s perfectly astounding, you might say
surprising, how easy thoughts come to
me. I ought to been a writer; lots of
folks have said so. Why, there ain&#8217;t a
<a name="png.018" id="png.018"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">13</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>day of my life that I don&#8217;t get a poem in
my head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo; observed Jimmy Fallows.
&ldquo;I&#8217;d as lief read figgers on a tow-boat
as to read poetry. Old man Gusty used
to write poetry, but he couldn&#8217;t get nobody
to print it, so he decided to start a
newspaper at the Cove and chuck it full
of his own poems. He bought a whole
printin&#8217; outfit, and set it up in Pete
Aker&#8217;s old carpenter shop out there at
the edge of town, opposite his home. But
&#8217;fore he got his paper started he up and
died. Yes, sir; and the only one of his
poems that he ever did git in print was
the one his wife had cut on his tombstone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp was not listening. With his
head bared and his lips parted he was indulging
in his principal weakness. For
Mr. Opp, it must be confessed, was given
to violent intoxication, not from an extraneous
source, but from too liberal
draughts of his own imagination. In
extenuation, the claims of genius might
be urged, for a genius he unquestionably
<a name="png.019" id="png.019"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">14</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>was in that he created something out of
nothing. Out of an abnormal childhood,
a lonely boyhood, and a failure-haunted
manhood, he had managed to achieve an
absorbing career. Each successive enterprise
had loomed upon his horizon big
with possibilities, and before it sank to
oblivion, another scheme, portentous,
significant, had filled its place. Life was
a succession of crises, and through them
he saw himself moving, now a shrewd
merchant, now a professional man, again
an author of note, but oftenest of all a
promoter of great enterprises, a financier,
and man of affairs.</p>

<p>While he was thus mentally engaged
in drilling oil-wells, composing poetry,
and selling shoes, Jimmy Fallows was
contemplating with fascinated wonder an
object that floated from his coat pocket.
From a brown-paper parcel, imperfectly
wrapped, depended a curl of golden hair,
and it bobbed about in the breeze in a
manner that reduced Mr. Fallows to a
state of abject curiosity.</p>

<p>So intent was Jimmy upon his investigation
<a name="png.020" id="png.020"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">15</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>that he failed to hold his course,
and the launch swung around the end of
the island with such a sudden jerk that
Mr. Opp took an unexpected seat.</p>

<p>As he did so, his hand touched the
paper parcel in his pocket, and realizing
that it was untied, he hastily endeavored,
by a series of surreptitious man&oelig;uvers,
to conceal what it contained. Feeling the
quizzical eye of his shipmate full upon
him, he assumed an air of studied indifference,
and stoically ignored the subterranean
chuckles and knowing winks in
which Mr. Fallows indulged.</p>

<p>Presently, when the situation had become
poignant, Mr. Opp observed that he
supposed the funeral would take place
from the church.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon so,&rdquo; said Jimmy, reluctantly
answering to the call of the conversational
rudder. &ldquo;I told the boys to have
a hack there for you and Mr. Ben and
Miss Kippy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t think my sister will be there,&rdquo;
said Mr. Opp, with dignity; &ldquo;she seldom
or never leaves the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.021" id="png.021"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">16</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Reckon Mr. Ben will have to take
keer of her now,&rdquo; said Jimmy; &ldquo;she
surely will miss her pa. He never done
a lick of work since I knowed him, but he
was a nice, quiet old fellow, and he certainly
was good to pore Miss Kippy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Moore was a gentleman,&rdquo; said
Mr. Opp, and he sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&#8217;t she got any kin on his side?
No folks except you two half-brothers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s all,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp; &ldquo;just I
and Ben.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee! that&#8217;s kind of tough on you <ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 original shows a period">all,</ins>
ain&#8217;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the sympathy was untimely, for
Mr. Opp&#8217;s dignity had been touched in a
sensitive place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our sister will be well provided for,&rdquo;
he said, and the conversation suffered a
relapse.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">Mr. Opp went back to his time-tables
and his new note-book, and for the rest
of the trip Jimmy devoted himself to his
wheel, with occasional ocular excursions
in the direction of Mr. Opp&#8217;s coat pocket.</p>

<p class="start"><img class="initial" src="images/l-initial.png"
 alt="L" width="158" height="150" /><span>ying</span> in the crook of the
river&#8217;s elbow, with the
nearest railroad eighteen
miles away, Cove City,
familiarly known as the
Cove, rested serenely undisturbed
by the progress of the world.
Once a day, at any time between sundown
and midnight, it was roused from
its drowsiness by the arrival of the mail-boat,
and, shaking itself into temporary
wakefulness, sat up and rubbed its eyes.
This animation was, however, of short
duration, for before the packet had
whistled for the next landing, the Cove
had once more settled back into slumber.</p>

<p>Main Street began with a shabby, unpainted
school-house, and following dramatic
sequence, ended abruptly in the
graveyard. Two cross-streets, which had
started out with laudable ideas of
<a name="png.023" id="png.023"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">18</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>independence, lost courage at Main Street
and sought strength in union; but the
experiment was not successful, and a
cow-path was the result. The only semblance
of frivolity about the town was a
few straggling cottages on stilts of varying
height as they approached the river;
for they seemed ever in the act of holding
up their skirts preparatory to wading
forth into the water.</p>

<p>On this particular summer afternoon
Cove City was less out of crimp than
usual. The gathering of loafers that
generally decorated the empty boxes
piled along the sidewalk was missing.
The old vehicles and weary-looking
mules which ordinarily formed an irregular
fringe along the hitching rail were
conspicuously absent. A subdued excitement
was in the air, and at the slightest
noise feminine heads appeared at
windows, and masculine figures appeared
in doorways, and comments were exchanged
in low tones from one side of
the street to the other. For the loss of
a citizen, even a poor one, disturbs the
<a name="png.024" id="png.024"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">19</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>surface of affairs, and when the event
brings two relatives from a distance, the
ripples of excitement increase perceptibly.</p>

<p>Mr. Moore had been a citizen-in-law,
as it were, and had never been considered
in any other light than poor Mrs. Opp&#8217;s
widower. Mrs. Opp&#8217;s poor widower
might have been a truer way of stating
it, but even a town has its parental weaknesses.</p>

<p>For two generations the Opp family
had been a source of mystery and romance
to the Cove. It stood apart, like
the house that held it, poor and shabby,
but bearing a baffling atmosphere of gentility,
of superiority, and of reserve.</p>

<p>Old women recalled strange tales of
the time when Mrs. Opp had come to the
Cove as a bride, and how she refused to
meet any of the townspeople, and lived
alone in the old house on the river-bank,
watching from hour to hour for the wild
young husband who clerked on one of the
river steamers. They told how she grew
thin and white with waiting, and how,
<a name="png.025" id="png.025"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">20</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>when her two boys were small, she made
them stand beside her for hours at a
time, watching the river and listening for
the whistle of his boat. Then the story
went that the gay young husband stopped
coming altogether, and still she watched
and waited, never allowing the boys out
of her sight, refusing to send them to
school, or to let them play with other
children. By and by word was brought
that her husband had been killed in a
quarrel over cards, and little Mrs. Opp,
having nothing now to watch for and to
wait for, suddenly became strangely
changed.</p>

<p>Old Aunt Tish, the negro servant, was
the only person who ever crossed the
threshold, and she told of a strange life
that went on behind the closely curtained
windows, where the sunlight was never
allowed to enter, and lamps burned all
day long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yas, &#8217;m,&rdquo; she used to say in answer
to curious questionings; &ldquo;hit&#8217;s jes like
play-actin&#8217; all de time. The Missis dress
herself up, an&#8217; &#8217;tend like she&#8217;s a queen
<a name="png.026" id="png.026"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">21</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>or a duke or somethin&#8217;, an&#8217; dat little D.
he jes acts out all dem fool things she
tells him to, an&#8217; he ain&#8217;t never bein&#8217; hisself
at all, but jes somebody big and
mighty and grand-like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the boys were half-grown, a
stranger appeared in the Cove, a dapper
little man of about fifty in a shabby frock-coat
and a shabbier high hat, kind of face
and gentle of voice, but with the dignity
of conscious superiority. The day of his
arrival he called upon Mrs. Opp; the
second day he took a preacher with him
and married her. Whatever old romance
had led to this climax could only be dimly
guessed at by the curious townspeople.</p>

<p>For two years Mr. Moore fought for
the mind of his old sweetheart as he had
long ago fought for her heart. He
opened the house to the sunshine, and
coaxed the little lady back into the world
she had forgotten. The boys were sent
to school, the old games and fancies were
forbidden. Gradually the color returned
to her cheeks, and the light to her eyes.</p>

<p>Then little Kippy was born, and
<a name="png.027" id="png.027"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">22</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>happiness such as seldom comes to one who
has tasted the dregs of life came to the
frail little woman in the big four-poster
bed. For ten days she held the baby fingers
to her heart, and watched the little
blossom of a maid unfold.</p>

<p>But one black night, when the rain
beat against the panes, and the moan of
the river sounded in her ears, she suddenly
sat up in bed: she had heard the
whistle of <em>his</em> boat! Full of dumb terror
she crept to the window, and with her
face pressed against the glass she waited
and watched. The present was swallowed
up in the past. She was once more
alone, unloved, afraid. Stealthily snatching
a cloak, she crept down into the garden,
feeling her way through the sodden
grass, and the jimpson weed which the
rain had beaten down.</p>

<p>And ever since, when children pass the
house on their way to school, they peep
through the broken fence rails, and point
out to one another, in awed tones, the
tree under which Miss Kippy&#8217;s mother
killed herself. Then they look half-fearfully
<a name="png.028" id="png.028"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">23</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>at the windows in the hope of catching
a glimpse of Miss Kippy herself.</p>

<p>For Kippy had had a long illness in
her thirteenth year which left her with
the face and mind of a little child, and
kindly, shabby Mr. Moore, having made
the supreme effort of his life, from this
time on ceased to struggle against the
weakness that for half a lifetime had beset
him, and sought oblivion in innocuous
but perpetual libations. The one duty
which he recognized was the care of his
invalid daughter.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">As soon as they were old enough, the
boys launched their small craft and set
forth to seek their fortunes. Ben, with
no cargo on board but his own desires,
went west and found a snug and comfortable
harbor, while D.&nbsp;Webster, the
hope of his mother and the pride of the
town, was at thirty-five still putting out
to sea, with all sail set, only to find himself
again and again aground on the
sandbars of the old familiar Cove.</p>



<h2 class="chap"><a name="png.029" id="png.029"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">24</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>III</h2>


<p class="start"><img class="initial" src="images/j-initial.png"
 alt="J" title="J" width="156" height="150" /><span>immy Fallows</span>, being the
boastful possessor of the
fleetest horse in town,
was the first to return
from the funeral. Extricating
himself with
some difficulty from the narrow-seated
buggy, he held out his hand to Mrs. Fallows.
But that imposing lady, evidently
offended with her jovial lord, refused his
proffered aid, and clambered out over
the wheel on the other side.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fallows, whose architectural effects
were strictly perpendicular, cast a
perpetual shadow of disapproval over
the life partner whom it had pleased
Providence to bestow upon her. Jimmy
was a born satirist; he knew things are
not what they seem, and he wickedly rejoiced
thereat. To his literal,
<a name="png.030" id="png.030"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">25</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>pious-minded wife he at times seemed the
incarnation of wickedness.</p>

<p>Sweeping with dignity beneath the
arching sign of Your Hotel, she took her
seat upon the porch, and, disposing her
sable robes about her, folded her mitted
hands, and waited to see the people return
from the funeral.</p>

<p>Jimmy, with the uncertain expression
of one who is ready to apologize, but cannot
remember the offense, hovered about
uneasily, casting tempting bits of conversational
bait into the silence, but failing
to attract so much as a nibble of
attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Jemima Fenny was over to the
funeral from Birdtown. Miss Jim is one
of &#8217;em, ain&#8217;t she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no response.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had her brother Nick with her. He&#8217;s
just gettin&#8217; over typhoid fever; looks
about the size and color of a slate pencil.
I bet, in spite of Miss Jim&#8217;s fine clothes,
they ain&#8217;t had a square meal for a month.
That&#8217;s because she kept him at school so
long when he orter been at work. He did
<a name="png.031" id="png.031"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">26</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>git a job in a newspaper office over at
Coreyville not long &#8217;fore he was took
sick. They tell me he&#8217;s as slick as a
onion about newspaper work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Continued silence; but Jimmy boldly
cast another fly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last funeral we had was Mrs. Tucker&#8217;s,
wasn&#8217;t it? Old man Tucker was
there to-day. Crape band on his hat is
climbin&#8217; up; it&#8217;ll be at high mast ag&#8217;in
soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dense, nerve-racking silence; but
Jimmy made one more effort:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Opps are coming back here tonight
to talk things over before Ben goes
on to Missouri. He counts on ketchin&#8217;
the night boat. It won&#8217;t give him much
time, will it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mrs. Fallows, unrelaxed, stared
fixedly before her; she had taken refuge
in that most trying of all rejoinders, silence,
and the fallible Jimmy, who waxed
strong and prospered upon abuse,
drooped and languished under this new
and cruel form of punishment.</p>

<p>It was not until a buggy stopped at the
<a name="png.032" id="png.032"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">27</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>door, and the Opp brothers descended,
that the tension was in any way relieved.</p>

<p>Jimmy greeted them with the joy of an
Arctic explorer welcoming a relief party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come right on in here, in the office,&rdquo;
he cried hospitably; &ldquo;your talkin&#8217;
won&#8217;t bother me a speck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Ben abruptly expressed his desire
for more private quarters, and led the
way up-stairs.</p>

<p>The low-ceiled room into which he
ushered D.&nbsp;Webster was of such a depressing
drab that even the green and
red bed-quilt failed to disperse the
gloom. The sole decoration, classic in
its severity, was a large advertisement
for a business college, whereon an elk&#8217;s
head grew out of a bow of ribbon, the
horns branching and rebranching into a
forest of curves and flourishes.</p>

<p>The elder Opp took his seat by the
window, and drummed with impatient
fingers on the sill. He was small, like his
brother, but of a compact, sturdy build.
His chin, instead of dwindling to a point,
was square and stubborn, and his eyes
<a name="png.033" id="png.033"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">28</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>looked straight ahead at the thing he
wanted, and neither saw nor cared for
what lay outside. He had been trying
ever since leaving the cemetery to bring
the conversation down to practical matters,
but D.&nbsp;Webster, seizing the first opportunity
of impressing himself upon his
next of kin, had persisted in indulging in
airy and time-destroying flights of fancy.</p>

<p>The truth is that our Mr. Opp was not
happy. In his secret heart he felt a bit
apologetic before the material success of
his elder brother. Hence it was necessary
to talk a great deal and to set forth
in detail the very important business
enterprises upon which he was about to
embark.</p>

<p>Presently Ben Opp looked at his
watch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he interrupted, &ldquo;that boat
may be along at any time. We&#8217;d better
come to some decision about the estate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>D.&nbsp;Webster ran his fingers through his
hair, which stood in valiant defense of
the small bald spot behind it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;business is
<a name="png.034" id="png.034"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">29</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>business. I&#8217;ll have to be off myself the very
first thing in the morning. This funeral
couldn&#8217;t have come at a more unfortunate
time for me. You see, my special
territory&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Ben saw the danger of another
bolt, and checked him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much do you think the old house
is worth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>D.&nbsp;Webster drew forth his shiny note-book
and pencil and made elaborate calculations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say,&rdquo; he said, as one financier
to another, &ldquo;that including of the
house and land and contents of same, it
would amount to the whole sum total of
about two thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is about what I figured,&rdquo; said
Ben; &ldquo;now, how much money is in the
bank?&rdquo;</p>

<p>D.&nbsp;Webster produced a formidable
packet of letters and papers from his inside
pocket and, after some searching,
succeeded in finding a statement, which
set forth the fact that the Ripper County
Bank held in trust one thousand dollars,
<a name="png.035" id="png.035"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">30</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to be divided between the children of
Mary Opp Moore at the death of her
husband, Curtis V. Moore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One thousand dollars!&rdquo; said Ben,
looking blankly at his brother, &ldquo;Why,
for heaven&#8217;s sake, what have Mr. Moore
and Kippy been living on all these
years?&rdquo;</p>

<p>D.&nbsp;Webster moved uneasily in his
chair. &ldquo;Oh, they&#8217;ve managed to get
along first rate,&rdquo; he said evasively.</p>

<p>His brother looked at him narrowly.
&ldquo;On the interest of a thousand dollars?&rdquo;
He leaned forward, and his face hardened:
&ldquo;See here, have you been putting
up cash all this time for that old codger
to loaf on? Is that why you have never
gotten ahead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>D.&nbsp;Webster, with hands in his pockets
and his feet stretched in front of him,
was blinking in furious embarrassment
at the large-eyed elk overhead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To think,&rdquo; went on Ben, his slow
wrath rising, &ldquo;of your staying here in
Kentucky all these years and handing
out what you made to that old sponger.
<a name="png.036" id="png.036"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">31</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>I cut loose and made a neat little sum,
married, and settled down. And what
have you done? Where have you gotten?
Anybody that would let himself be imposed
upon like that deserves to fail.
Now what do you propose to do about
this money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp did not propose to do anything.
The affront offered his business
sagacity was of such a nature that it demanded
all his attention. He composed
various denunciatory answers with which
to annihilate his brother. He hesitated
between two courses, whether he should
hurl himself upon him in righteous indignation
and demand physical satisfaction,
or whether he should rise in a calm and
manly attitude and wither him with
blighting sarcasm. And while the decision
was pending, he still sat with his
hands in his pockets, and his feet
stretched forth, and blinked indignantly
at the ornate elk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The estate,&rdquo; continued Ben, contempt
still in his face, &ldquo;amounts at most
to three thousand dollars, after the house
<a name="png.037" id="png.037"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">32</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>is sold. Part of this, of course, will go
to the maintenance of Kippy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At mention of her name, Mr. Opp&#8217;s
gaze dropped abruptly to his brother&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about Kippy? She&#8217;s going to
live with you, ain&#8217;t she?&rdquo; he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>Ben Opp shook his head emphatically.
&ldquo;She certainly is not. I haven&#8217;t the
slightest idea of burdening myself and
family with that feeble-minded girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But see here,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, his anger
vanishing in the face of this new
complication, &ldquo;you don&#8217;t know Kippy;
she&#8217;s just similar to a little child, quiet
and gentle-like. Never give anybody any
trouble in her life. Just plays with her
dolls and sings to herself all day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Ben; &ldquo;twenty-five
years old and still playing with dolls. I
saw her yesterday, dressed up in all
sorts of foolish toggery, talking to her
hands, and laughing. Aunt Tish humors
her, and her father humored her, but
I&#8217;m not going to. I feel sorry for her
<a name="png.038" id="png.038"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">33</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>all right, but I am not going to take her
home with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>D.&nbsp;Webster nervously twisted the
large seal ring which he wore on his
forefinger. &ldquo;Then what do you mean,&rdquo;
he said hesitatingly&mdash;&ldquo;what do you want
to do about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, send her to an asylum, of
course. That&#8217;s where she ought to have
been all these years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp, sitting upon the small of his
back, with one leg wrapped casually
about the leg of the chair, stared at him
for a moment in consternation, then,
gathering himself together, rose and for
the first time since we have met him
seemed completely to fill his checked
ready-made suit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send Kippy to a lunatic asylum!&rdquo; he
said in tones so indignant that they made
his chin tremble. &ldquo;You will do nothing
whatever of the kind! Why, all she&#8217;s
ever had in the world was her pa and
Aunt Tish and her home; now he&#8217;s gone,
you ain&#8217;t wanting to take the others
away from her too, are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.039" id="png.039"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">34</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Well, who is going to take care of
her?&rdquo; demanded Ben angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; announced D.&nbsp;Webster, striking
as fine an attitude as ever his illustrious
predecessor struck; &ldquo;you take the
money that&#8217;s in the bank, and leave me
the house and Kippy. That&#8217;ll be her
share and mine. I can take care of her;
I don&#8217;t ask favors of nobody. Suppose
I do lose my job; I&#8217;ll get me another.
There&#8217;s a dozen ways I can make a living.
There ain&#8217;t a man in the State
that&#8217;s got more resources than me. I
got plans laid now that&#8217;ll revolutionize&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ben, quietly, &ldquo;you always
could do great things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>D.&nbsp;Webster&#8217;s egotism, inflated to the
utmost, burst at this prick, and he suddenly
collapsed. Dropping limply into
the chair by the table, he held his hand
over his mouth to hide his agitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&#8217;s&mdash;there&#8217;s one thing,&rdquo; he began,
swallowing violently, and winking
after each word, &ldquo;that I&mdash;I can&#8217;t
<a name="png.040" id="png.040"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">35</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>do&mdash;and that&#8217;s to leave a&mdash;sister&mdash;to die&mdash;among
strangers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, to his mortification, his
head went unexpectedly down upon his
arms, and a flood of tears bedimmed the
radiance of his twenty-five-cent four-in-hand.</p>

<p>From far down the river came the
whistle of the boat, and, in the room below,
Jimmy Fallows removed a reluctant
ear from the stove-pipe hole.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&ldquo;Melindy,&rdquo; he said confidentially, entirely
forgetting the late frost, &ldquo;I never
see anybody in the world that stood as
good a show of gittin&#8217; the fool prize as
that there D.&nbsp;Opp.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="start"><img class="initial" src="images/t-initial.png"
 alt="T" title="T" width="149" height="150" /><span>he</span> old Opp House stood
high on the river-bank
and gazed lonesomely out
into the summer night.
It was a shabby, down-at-heel,
dejected-looking
place, with one side showing faint lights,
above and below, but the other side so
nailed up and empty and useless that it
gave the place the appearance of being
paralyzed down one side and of having
scarcely enough vitality left to sustain
life in the other.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, an old hound
howled dismally on the door-step, only
stopping occasionally to paw at the iron
latch and to whimper for the master
whose unsteady footsteps he had followed
for thirteen years.</p>

<p>In the front room a shaded lamp,
<a name="png.042" id="png.042"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">37</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>turned low, threw a circle of light on the
table and floor, leaving the corners full
of vague, uncertain shadows. From the
wide, black fireplace a pair of rusty and
battered andirons held out empty arms,
and on the high stone shelf above the
opening, flanked on each side by a stuffed
owl, was a tall, square-faced clock, with
the hour-hand missing. The minute-hand
still went on its useless round, and
behind it, on the face of the clock, a tiny
schooner with all sail set rocked with the
swinging of the pendulum.</p>

<p>The loud ticking of the clock, and the
lamentations of the hound without, were
not the only sounds that disturbed the
night. Before the empty fireplace, in a
high-backed, cane-bottomed chair, slept
an old negress, with head bowed, moaning
and muttering as she slept. She was
bent and ashen with age, and her brown
skin sagged in long wrinkles from her
face and hands. On her forehead, reaching
from brow to faded turban, was a
hideous testimony to some ancient conflict.
A large, irregular hole, over which
<a name="png.043" id="png.043"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">38</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the flesh had grown, pulsed as sentiently
and imperatively as a naked, living
heart.</p>

<p>A shutter slammed sharply somewhere
in the house above, and something stirred
fearfully in the shadow of the room. It
was a small figure that crouched against
the wall, listening and watching with the
furtive terror of a newly captured coyote&mdash;the
slight figure of a woman dressed
as a child, with short gingham dress, and
heelless slippers, and a bright ribbon
holding back the limp, flaxen hair from
her strange, pinched face.</p>

<p>Again and again her wide, frightened
eyes sought the steps leading to the room
above, and sometimes she would lean
forward and whisper in agonized expectancy,
&ldquo;Daddy?&rdquo; Then when no answer
came, she would shudder back
against the wall, cold and shaking and
full of dumb terrors.</p>

<p>Suddenly the hound&#8217;s howling changed
to a sharp bark, and the old negress
stirred and stretched herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ails dat air dog?&rdquo; she
<a name="png.044" id="png.044"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">39</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>mumbled, going to the window, and shading
her eyes with her hand. &ldquo;You&#8217;d &#8217;low
to hear him tell it he done heared old
master coming up de road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That somebody was coming was evident
from the continued excitement of
the hound, and when the gate slammed
and a man&#8217;s voice sounded in the darkness,
Aunt Tish opened the door, throwing
a long, dim patch of light out across
the narrow porch and over the big, round
stepping-stones beyond.</p>

<p>Into the light came Mr. Opp, staggering
under the load of his baggage, his
coat over his arm, his collar off, thoroughly
spent with the events of the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord &#8217;a&#8217; mercy!&rdquo; said Aunt Tish,
&ldquo;if hit ain&#8217;t Mr. D.! I done give you up
long ago. I certainly is glad you come.
Miss Kippy&#8217;s jes carrying on like ever&#8217;thing.
She ain&#8217;t been to baid for two
nights, an&#8217; I can&#8217;t do nothin&#8217; &#8217;t all wif
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp deposited his things in a corner,
and, tired as he was, assumed an air
of authority. It was evident that a man
<a name="png.045" id="png.045"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">40</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>was needed, a person of firmness, of decision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll see that she goes to bed at once,&rdquo;
he said resolutely. &ldquo;Where is she at?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&#8217;s behind de door,&rdquo; said Aunt
Tish; &ldquo;she&#8217;s be&#8217;n so skeered ever sence
her paw died I can&#8217;t do nothin&#8217; wif her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kippy,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, sternly,
&ldquo;come out here this minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there was no response. Going to
the corner where his coat lay, he took
from the pocket a brown-paper parcel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Kippy,&rdquo; he said in a greatly
mollified tone, &ldquo;I wish you would come
on out here and see me. You remember
brother D., don&#8217;t you? You ought to see
what I brought you all the way from the
city. It&#8217;s got blue eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this the small, grotesque figure, distrustful,
suspicious, ready to take flight
at a word, ventured slowly forth. So
slight she was, and so frail, and so softly
she moved, it was almost as if the wind
blew her toward him. Every thought
that came into her brain was instantly
reflected in her hypersensitive face, and
<a name="png.046" id="png.046"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">41</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>as she stood before him nervously plucking
her fingers, fear and joy struggled
for supremacy. Suddenly with a low cry
she snatched the doll from him and
clasped it to her heart.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Aunt Tish had spread a
cloth on the table and set forth some cold
corn dodger, a pitcher of foaming butter-milk,
and a plate of cold corned beef.
The milk was in a battered pewter
pitcher, but the dish that held the corn
bread was of heavy silver, with intricate
chasings about the rim.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp, with his head propped on his
hand, ate wearily. He had been up since
four o&#8217;clock that morning, and to-morrow
he must be up at daybreak if he was
to keep his engagements to supply the
dealers with the greatest line of shoes
ever put upon the market. Between now
and then he must decide many things:
Kippy must be planned for, the house
gone over, and arrangements made for
the future. Being behind the scenes, as
it were, and having no spectator to impress,
he allowed himself to sink into an
<a name="png.047" id="png.047"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">42</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>attitude of extreme dejection. And Mr.
Opp, shorn of the dignity of his heavily
padded coat, and his imposing collar and
tie, and with even his pompadour limp
upon his forehead, failed entirely to give
a good imitation of himself.</p>

<p>As he sat thus, with one hand hanging
limply over the back of the chair, he felt
something touch it softly, dumbly, as a
dog might. Looking down, he discovered
Miss Kippy sitting on the floor,
close behind him, watching him with
furtive eyes. In one arm she cradled the
new doll, and in the other she held his
coat.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp patted her cheek: &ldquo;Whatever
are you doing with my coat?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Miss Kippy held it behind her, and
nodded her head wisely: &ldquo;Keeping it so
you can&#8217;t go away,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;I&#8217;ll hold it tight all night. To-morrow
I&#8217;ll hide it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&#8217;m a business man,&rdquo; said Mr.
Opp, unconsciously straightening his
shoulders. &ldquo;A great deal of responsibility
depends on me. I&#8217;ve got to be off
<a name="png.048" id="png.048"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">43</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>early in the morning; but I&#8217;m coming
back to see you real often&mdash;every now
and then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Kippy&#8217;s whole attitude changed.
She caught his hand and clung to it, and
the terror came back to her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mustn&#8217;t go,&rdquo; she whispered,
her body quivering with excitement.
&ldquo;It&#8217;ll get me if you do. Daddy kept It
away, and you can keep It away; but
Aunt Tish can&#8217;t: she&#8217;s afraid of It, too!
She goes to sleep, and then It reaches at
me through the window. It comes down
the chimney, there&mdash;where you see the
brick&#8217;s loose. Don&#8217;t leave me, D.
Hush, don&#8217;t you hear It?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice had risen to hysteria, and
she clung to him, cold and shaken by the
fear that possessed her.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp put a quieting arm about
her. &ldquo;Why, see here, Kippy,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;didn&#8217;t you know It was afraid of me?
Look how strong I am! I could kill It
with my little finger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you?&rdquo; asked Miss Kippy,
fearfully.</p>

<p><a name="png.049" id="png.049"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">44</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp.
&ldquo;Don&#8217;t you ever be scared of anything
whatsoever when Brother D.&#8217;s round.
I&#8217;m going to take care of you from now
on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This me is bad,&rdquo; announced Miss
Kippy; &ldquo;the other me is good. Her
name is Oxety; she has one blue eye and
one brown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Oxety must go to bed now,&rdquo;
said Mr. Opp; &ldquo;it must be getting awful
late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Miss Kippy shook her head.
&ldquo;You might go &#8217;way,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Finding that he could not persuade
her, Mr. Opp resorted to strategy: &ldquo;I&#8217;ll
tell you what let&#8217;s me and you do.
Let&#8217;s put your slippers on your hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">This proposition met with instant approval.
It appealed to Miss Kippy as a
brilliant suggestion. She assisted in unbuttoning
the single straps and watched
with glee as they were fastened about
her wrists.</p>

<p class="illus pgbrk"><a name="png.050" id="png.050"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">45</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span><img src="images/illus050.jpg" width="450" height="710"
 alt="" title="" /><br
 />&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&#8217;t leave me&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, with assumed
enthusiasm, &ldquo;we&#8217;ll make the slippers
<a name="png.052" id="png.052"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">47</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>walk you up-stairs, and after Aunt Tish
undresses you, they shall walk you to
bed. Won&#8217;t that be fun?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Kippy&#8217;s fancy was so tickled by
this suggestion that she put it into practice
at once, and went gaily forth up the
steps on all fours. At the turn she
stopped, and looked at him wistfully:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;ll come up before I go to
sleep?&rdquo; she begged; &ldquo;Daddy did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Half an hour later Aunt Tish came
down the narrow stairway: &ldquo;She done
gone to baid now, laughin&#8217; an&#8217; happy
ag&#8217;in,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;she never did have
dem spells when her paw was round, an&#8217;
sometimes dat chile jes as clear in her
mind as you an&#8217; me is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it she&#8217;s afraid of?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Opp.</p>

<p>Aunt Tish leaned toward him across
the table, and the light of the lamp fell
full upon her black, bead-like eyes, and
her sunken jaws, and on the great palpitating
scar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;De ghosties,&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;dey
been worriting dat chile ever&#8217; chance dey
<a name="png.053" id="png.053"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">48</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>git. <em>I</em> hear &#8217;em! Dey wait till I take a
nap of sleep, den dey comes sneakin&#8217; in
to pester her. She says dey ain&#8217;t but
one, but I hears heaps ob &#8217;em, some ob
&#8217;em so little dey kin climb onder de crack
in de door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look a-here, Aunt Tish,&rdquo; said Mr.
Opp, sternly, &ldquo;don&#8217;t you ever talk a
word of this foolishness to her again.
Not one word, do you hear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yas, sir; dat&#8217;s what Mr. Moore allays
said, an&#8217; I <em>don&#8217;t</em> talk to her &#8217;bout
hit, I don&#8217;t haf to. She done knows I
know. I been livin&#8217; heah goin&#8217; on forty
years, sence &#8217;fore you was borned, an&#8217;
you can&#8217;t fool me, chile; no, sir, dat you
can&#8217;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you must go to bed now,&rdquo; said
Mr. Opp, looking up at the clock and
seeing that it was half-past something
though he did not know what.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never goes to baid when I stays
here,&rdquo; announced Aunt Tish; &ldquo;I sets up
in de kitchen an&#8217; sleeps. I&#8217;s skeered dat
chile run away; she &#8217;low she gwine to
some day. Her paw ketched her oncet
<a name="png.054" id="png.054"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">49</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>gittin&#8217; in a boat down on de river-bank.
She ain&#8217;t gwine, while I&#8217;s here, no
sir-ee! I never leaves her in de daytime
an&#8217; her paw never leaves her at night,
dat is, when he&#8217;s livin&#8217;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After she had gone, Mr. Opp ascended
the stairway, and entered the room
above. A candle sputtered on the table,
and in its light he saw the wide, four-poster
bed that had been his mother&#8217;s,
and in it the frail figure of little Miss
Kippy. Her hair lay loose upon the pillow,
and on her sleeping face, appealing
in its helplessness, was a smile of perfect
peace. The new doll lay on the table
beside the candle, but clasped tightly in
her arms was the coat of many checks.</p>

<p>For a moment Mr. Opp stood watching
her, then he drew his shirt-sleeve
quickly across his eyes. As he turned to
descend, his new shoes creaked painfully
and, after he had carefully removed
them, he tiptoed down, passed through
the sitting-room and out upon the porch,
where he sank down on the step and
dropped his head on his arms.</p>

<p><a name="png.055" id="png.055"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">50</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The night was very still, save for the
croaking of a bullfrog, and the incessant
scraping of a cedar-tree against the corner
of the roof. From across the river,
faint sparks of light shone out from
cabin windows, and, below, a moving
light now and then told of a passing
scow. Once a steamboat slipped weirdly
out of the darkness, sparkling with
lights, and sending up faint sounds of
music; but before the waves from the
wheel had ceased to splash on the bank
below, she was swallowed up in the darkness,
leaving lonesomeness again.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp sat staring out into the night,
outwardly calm, but inwardly engaged in
a mortal duel. The aggressive Mr. Opp
of the gorgeous raiment and the seal
ring, the important man of business, the
ambitious financier, was in deadly combat
with the insignificant Mr. Opp, he of
the shirt-sleeves and the wilted pompadour,
the delicate, sensitive, futile Mr.
Opp who was incapable of everything
but the laying down of his life for the
sake of another.</p>

<p><a name="png.056" id="png.056"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">51</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>A dull line of light hovered on the
horizon, and gradually the woods on the
opposite shore took shape, then the big
river itself, gray and shimmering, with
streaks on the water where a snag broke
the swift current.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. D.,&rdquo; he heard Aunt Tish calling
up the back stairs, &ldquo;you better git out of
baid; hit&#8217;s sun-up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rose stiffly and started back to the
kitchen. As he passed through the front
room, his eyes fell upon his new suit-case
full of the treasured drummers&#8217;
samples. Stooping down, he traced the
large black letters with his finger and
sighed deeply.</p>

<p>Then he got up resolutely and
marched to the kitchen door.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&ldquo;Aunt Tish,&rdquo; he said with authority,
&ldquo;you needn&#8217;t mind about hurrying
breakfast. I find there&#8217;s very important
business will keep me here in the Cove
for the present.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="start"><img class="initial" src="images/t-initial.png"
 alt="T" title="T" width="149" height="150" /><span>here</span> were two methods of
communication in Cove
City, both of which were
equally effective. One
was the telephone, which
from a single, isolated
case had developed into an epidemic, and
the other, which enjoyed the dignity of
precedence and established custom, was
to tell Jimmy Fallows.</p>

<p>Both of these currents of information
soon overflowed with the news that Mr.
D.&nbsp;Webster Opp had given up a good
position in the city, and expected to establish
himself in business in his native
town. The nature of this business was
agitating the community at large in only
a degree less than it was agitating Mr.
Opp himself.</p>

<p>One afternoon Jimmy Fallows stood
<a name="png.058" id="png.058"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">53</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>with his back to his front gate, suspended
by his armpits from the pickets,
and conducted business after his usual
fashion. As a general retires to a hill-top
to organize his forces and issue
orders to his subordinates, so Jimmy
hung upon his front fence and conducted
the affairs of the town. He knew what
time each farmer came in, where the
&ldquo;Helping Hands&rdquo; were going to sew,
where the doctor was, and where the services
would be held next Sunday. He
was coroner, wharf-master, undertaker,
and notary, and the only thing in the
heavens above or the earth below concerning
which he did not attempt to give
information was the arrival of the next
steamboat.</p>

<p>As he stood whittling a stick and
cheerfully humming a tune of other
days, he descried a small, alert figure
coming up the road. The pace was so
much brisker than the ordinary slow gait
of the Cove that he recognized the person
at once as Mr. Opp. Whereupon he
lifted his voice and hailed a boy who was
<a name="png.059" id="png.059"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">54</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>just vanishing down the street in the
opposite direction:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nick!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Aw, Nick Fenny!
Tell Mat Lucas that Mr. Opp&#8217;s uptown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Connection being thus made at one
end of the line, he turned to effect it at
the other. &ldquo;Howdy, Brother Opp.
Kinder dusty on the river, ain&#8217;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we <em>are</em> experiencing considerable
of warm weather at this juncture,&rdquo;
said Mr. Opp, affably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat Lucas has been hanging round
here all day,&rdquo; said Jimmy. &ldquo;He wants
you to buy out a half-interest in his dry-goods
store. What do you think about
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, thrusting his
thumbs into the armholes of his waistcoat,
&ldquo;I am considering of a great
variety of different things. I been in
the dry-goods business twice, and I can&#8217;t
say but what it ain&#8217;t a pretty business.
Of course,&rdquo; he added with a twinge, &ldquo;my
specialty are shoes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jimmy; &ldquo;but the folks
<a name="png.060" id="png.060"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">55</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>here all gets their shoes at the drug
store. Mr. Toddlinger&#8217;s been carrying
a line of shoes along with his pills and
plasters ever sence he went into business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp looked up at the large sign
overhead. &ldquo;If you and Mr. Tucker
wasn&#8217;t both in the hotel business, I
might be thinking of considering that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This proposition tickled Jimmy immensely.
Chuckles of amusement agitated
his rotund figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&#8217;t you buy us both out?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;We could sell out for nothing
and make money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, there&#8217;s three boarders sitting
over at Our Hotel now,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp,
who rather fancied himself in the rôle of
a genial host.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jimmy. &ldquo;Old man
Tucker&#8217;s had &#8217;em hanging out on the
line all morning. I don&#8217;t guess they got
strength enough to walk around much
after the meals he give &#8217;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, wholly
absorbed in his own affairs, &ldquo;this is just
<a name="png.061" id="png.061"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">56</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>temporarily for the time being, as it
were. In a year or so, when my financial
condition is sorter more established in a
way, I intend to put through that oil-wells
proposition. The fact that I am
aiming at arriving to is what would you
think the Cove was at present most in
need of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elbow-grease,&rdquo; said Jimmy,
promptly. &ldquo;The only two things that
we ain&#8217;t got that a city has, is elbow-grease
and a newspaper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment there was a silence,
heavy with significance. Mr. Fallows&#8217;s
gaze penetrated the earth, while Mr.
Opp&#8217;s scanned the heavens; then they
suddenly looked at each other, and the
great idea was born.</p>

<p>An editor! Mr. Opp&#8217;s whole being
thrilled responsive to the call. The
thought of dwelling above the sordid
bartering of commercial life, of being in
a position to exercise those mental
powers with which he felt himself so
generously endowed, almost swept him
off his feet. He had been a reporter
<a name="png.062" id="png.062"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">57</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>once; for two golden weeks he had
handed in police-court reports that fairly
scintillated with verbal gems plucked at
random from the dictionary. But the
city editor had indicated as kindly as
possible that his services were no longer
required, vaguely suggesting that it was
necessary to reduce the force; and Mr.
Opp had assured him that he understood
perfectly, and that he was ready to return
at any future time. That apprenticeship,
brief though it was, served as a
foundation upon which Mr. Opp erected
a tower of dazzling possibilities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s the matter with you takin&#8217;
Mr. Gusty&#8217;s old printin&#8217;-shop and
startin&#8217; up business for yourself?&rdquo;
asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you reckon she&#8217;d sell it?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Opp, anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sell it?&rdquo; said Jimmy. &ldquo;Why, she&#8217;s
&#8217;most ready to give it away to keep from
having to pay Pete Aker&#8217;s rent for the
shop. Say&mdash;Mr. Gall&mdash;up,&rdquo; he called
up the street to a man who was turning
the corner, &ldquo;is Mrs. Gusty at home?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.063" id="png.063"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">58</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The man, thus accosted, turned and
came toward them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is Mr. Gallop?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Opp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&#8217;s the new telephone girl,&rdquo; said
Jimmy, with relish; &ldquo;ain&#8217;t been here but
a month, and he&#8217;s doing the largest and
most profitable trade in tending to other
folks&#8217;s business you ever seen. Soft!
Why, he must &#8217;a&#8217; been raised on a pillow&mdash;He
always puts me in mind of a
highly educated pig: it sorter surprises
and tickles you to see him walkin&#8217; round
on his hind legs and talking like other
people. Other day one of the boys, just
to devil him, ast him to drive his team
out home. I liked to &#8217;a&#8217; died when I
seen him tryin&#8217; to turn the corner, pullin&#8217;
&lsquo;Gee&rsquo; and hollerin&#8217; &lsquo;Haw&rsquo; with every
breath. Old mules got their legs in a
hard knot trying to do both at once, and
the boys says when Gallop got out in the
country he felt so bad about it he got
down and &#8217;pologized to the mules. How
&#8217;bout that, Gallop&mdash;did you!&rdquo; he concluded
as the subject of the conversation
arrived upon the scene.</p>

<p><a name="png.064" id="png.064"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">59</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The new-comer, a plump, fair young
man, who held one hand clasped affectionately
in the other, blushed indignantly,
but said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This here is Mr. Opp,&rdquo; went on
Jimmy; &ldquo;he wants to see Mrs. Gusty.
Do you know whether he will ketch her
at home or not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Gallop was by this time paying
the tribute of many an admiring glance
to every detail of Mr. Opp&#8217;s costume,
and Mr. Opp, realizing this, assumed an
air of cosmopolitan nonchalance, and
toyed indifferently with his large watch-fob.</p>

<p>When Mr. Gallop&#8217;s admiration and
attention had become focused upon Mr.
Opp&#8217;s ring, he suddenly turned on the
faucet of his conversation, and allowed
such a stream of general information to
pour forth that Mr. Opp quite forgot to
look imposing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Gusty telephoned early this
morning to Mrs. Dorsey that she would
come over and help her make preserves.
Mrs. Dorsey got a big load of peaches
from her father across the river. He&#8217;s
<a name="png.065" id="png.065"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">60</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>been down with the asthma, and had to
call up the doctor twice in the night.
And the doctor couldn&#8217;t get the right
medicine in town, and had me call up the
city. They are going to send it down on
the <i>Big Sandy</i>, but she&#8217;s stuck in the
locks, and goodness knows when she&#8217;ll
get here. She&#8217;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Opp,
politely but firmly, &ldquo;I&#8217;ve got to see Mrs.
Gusty on very important business.
Have you any idea whatsoever of when
she will return back home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Gallop, eager to
oblige. &ldquo;She&#8217;s about home by this time.
Miss Lou Diker is making her a dress,
and she telephoned she&#8217;d be by to try it
on &#8217;bout four o&#8217;clock. I&#8217;ll go up there
with you, if you want me to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&#8217;t you drive him!&rdquo; suggested
Jimmy. &ldquo;You can borrow a pair
of mules acrost the street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Opp,&rdquo; said Mr. Gallop, feelingly,
as they walked up Main Street,
&ldquo;I wouldn&#8217;t treat a&#8217; insect like he treats
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.066" id="png.066"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">61</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Oh, you mustn&#8217;t mind Jimmy,&rdquo; said
Mr. Opp, kindly; &ldquo;he always sort of enjoys
a little joke as he goes along. Why,
I wouldn&#8217;t be at all surprised if he even
made a joke on me sometime. How long
have you been in Cove City?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a month,&rdquo; said Mr. Gallop. &ldquo;It
must look awful little to you, after all
the big cities you been used to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp lengthened his stride. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
he said largely; &ldquo;quite small, quite little,
in fact. No place for a business man;
but for a professional man, a man that
requires leisure to sort of cultivate his
brain and that means to be a influence
in the community, it&#8217;s a good place, a
remarkably good place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A hint, however vague, dropped into
the mind of Mr. Gallop, caused instant
fermentation. From long experience he
had become an adept at extracting information
from all who crossed his path.
A preliminary interest, a breath or two
of flattery by way of anesthetic, and his
victim&#8217;s secret was out before he knew it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reckon you are going up to talk
<a name="png.067" id="png.067"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">62</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>insurance to Mrs. Gusty,&rdquo; he ventured
tentatively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; oh, no,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp. &ldquo;I formerly
was in the insurance business,
some time back. Very little prospects
in it for a man of my nature. I have to
have a chance to sorter spread out, you
know&mdash;to use my own particular ideas
about working things out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your especial line?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Gallop, deferentially.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shoe&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Opp began involuntarily,
then checked himself&mdash;&ldquo;journalism,&rdquo;
he said, and the word seemed for
the moment completely to fill space.</p>

<p>At Mrs. Gusty&#8217;s gate Mr. Gallop
stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I ought to go back now,&rdquo; he
said regretfully; &ldquo;the telephone and
telegraph office is right there in my
room, and I never leave them day or
night except just this one hour in the
afternoon. It&#8217;s awful trying. The
farmers begin calling each other up at
three o&#8217;clock in the morning. Say, I
wish you&#8217;d step in sometime. I&#8217;d just
<a name="png.068" id="png.068"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">63</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>love to have you. But you are so busy
and got so many friends, you won&#8217;t have
much time for me, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">Mr. Opp thought otherwise. He said
that no matter how pressed he was by
various important duties, he was never
too busy to see a friend. And he said it
with the air of one who confers a favor,
and Mr. Gallop received it as one who
receives a favor, and they shook hands
warmly and parted.</p>




<h2 class="chap"><a name="png.069" id="png.069"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">64</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>VI</h2>


<p class="start"><img class="initial" src="images/m-initial.png"
 alt="M" title="M" width="155" height="150" /><span>r. Opp</span>, absorbed in the
great scheme which was
taking definite form in
his mind, did not discover
until he reached
the steps that some one
was lying in a hammock on the porch.</p>

<p>It was a dark-haired girl in a pink
dress, with a pink bow in her hair and
small bows on the toes of her high-heeled
slippers&mdash;the very kind of person, in
fact, that Mr. Opp was most desirous of
avoiding.</p>

<p>Fortunately she was asleep, and Mr.
Opp, after listening in vain at the door
for sounds of Mrs. Gusty within, tiptoed
cautiously to the other end of the
porch and took his seat on a straight-backed
settee.</p>

<p>Let it not for a moment be supposed
<a name="png.070" id="png.070"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">65</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>that Mr. Opp was a stranger to the fascinations
of femininity. He had been
inoculated at a tender age, and it had
taken so completely, so tragically, that
he had crept back to life with one illusion
sadly shattered, and the conviction
firm within him that henceforth he was
immune. His attitude toward the subject
remained, however, interested, but
cautious&mdash;such as a good little boy might
entertain toward a loaded pistol.</p>

<p>As he sat very straight and very still
on the green settee, he tried to compose
his mind for the coming interview with
Mrs. Gusty. Directly across the road
was Aker&#8217;s old carpenter-shop, a small,
square, one-story edifice, shabby, and
holding out scant promise of journalistic
possibilities. Mr. Opp, however, seldom
saw things as they were; he saw them as
they were going to be. Before five minutes
had elapsed he had the shop painted
white, with trimmings of red, new panes
in the windows, ground glass below and
clear above, an imposing sign over the
door, and the roadway blocked with
<a name="png.071" id="png.071"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">66</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>eager subscribers. He would have to
have an assistant, of course, some one to
attend to the general details; but he
would have charge of everything himself.
He would edit a paper, comprehensive
in its scope, and liberal in its views.
Science, art, religion, society, and politics
would all be duly chronicled. Politics!
Why, his paper would be an organ&mdash;an
organ of the Democratic Party!</p>

<p>At the thought of being an organ, Mr.
Opp&#8217;s bosom swelled with such pride
that his settee creaked, and he glanced
apprehensively toward the other end of
the porch.</p>

<p>The young lady was still asleep, with
her head resting on her bare arm, and
one foot hanging limply below her ruffled
petticoat.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mr. Opp leaned forward and
viewed her slipper with interest. He
had recognized the make! It was xxx-aa.
He had carried a sample exactly like it,
and had been wont to call enthusiastic
attention to the curve of the instep and
the set of the heel. He now realized that
<a name="png.072" id="png.072"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">67</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the effect depended entirely on the bow,
and he seriously considered writing to
the firm and suggesting the improvement.</p>

<p>In the midst of his reflections the
young lady stirred and then sat up. Her
hair was tumbled, and her eyes indicated
that she had been indulging in recent
tears. Resting her chin on her palms,
she gazed gloomily down the road.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp, at the other end of the
porch, also gazed gloomily down the
road. The fact that he must make his
presence known was annihilated by the
yet more urgent fact that he could think
of nothing to say. A bumblebee wheeled
in narrowing circles above his head and
finally lighted upon his coat-sleeve. But
Mr. Opp remained immovable. He
was searching his vocabulary for a word
which would gently crack the silence
without shattering it to bits.</p>

<p>The bumblebee saved the situation.
Detecting some rare viand in a crack of
the porch midway between the settee and
the hammock, and evidently being a
<a name="png.073" id="png.073"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">68</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>bibulous bee, it set up such a buzz of excitement
that Mr. Opp looked at it, and the
young lady looked at it, and their eyes
met.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, rather
breathlessly; &ldquo;you was asleep, and I
come to see Mrs. Gusty, and&mdash;er&mdash;the
fact is&mdash;I&#8217;m Mr. Opp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this announcement the young lady
put her hand to her head, and by a dexterous
movement rearranged the brown
halo of her hair, and twisted the pink
bow into its proper, aggressive position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother&#8217;ll&mdash;be back soon,&rdquo;&mdash;she
spoke without embarrassment, yet with
the hesitation of one who is not in the
habit of speaking for herself,&mdash;&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;didn&#8217;t
know I was going to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp; then added politely,
&ldquo;neither did I.&rdquo; Silence again
looming on the horizon, he plunged on:
&ldquo;I think I used to be in the habit of seeing
you when you was&mdash;er&mdash;younger,
didn&#8217;t I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up at the store.&rdquo; She smiled faintly.
&ldquo;You bought me a bag of pop-corn once
<a name="png.074" id="png.074"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">69</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>with a prize in it. It was a breastpin;
I&#8217;ve got it yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp scowled slightly as he tried
to extract an imaginary splinter from his
thumb. &ldquo;Do you&mdash;er&mdash;attend school?&rdquo;
he asked, taking refuge in a paternal
attitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m finished,&rdquo; she said listlessly.
&ldquo;I&#8217;ve been going to the Young Ladies&#8217;
Seminary at Coreyville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&#8217;t you taken to it?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Opp, wishing fervently that Mrs. Gusty
would return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said his companion, earnestly.
&ldquo;I love it; I was a special. I
took music and botany and painting. I
was in four concerts last year and played
in the double duets at the commencements.&rdquo;
During the pause that followed,
Mr. Opp considered various
names for his newspaper. &ldquo;Mother
isn&#8217;t going to let me go back,&rdquo; the soft,
drawling voice continued; &ldquo;she says
when a girl is nineteen she ought to settle
down. She wants me to get married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp laid &ldquo;The Cove Chronicle&rdquo;
<a name="png.075" id="png.075"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">70</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and &ldquo;The Weekly Bugle&rdquo; aside for further
consideration, and inquired politely
if there was any special person whom
Mrs. Gusty desired for a son-in-law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said the girl, indifferently;
&ldquo;she hasn&#8217;t thought of anybody. But I
don&#8217;t want to get married&mdash;yet. I want
to go back to the seminary and be a
music teacher. I hate it here, every bit
of it. It&#8217;s so stupid&mdash;and lonesome,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A break in her voice caused Mr. Opp
to postpone a decision of the day on
which his paper was to be published, and
to give her his undivided attention.
Distress, even in beauty, was not to be
withstood, and the fact that she was unusually
pretty had been annoying Mr.
Opp ever since she had spoken to him.
As she turned her head away and wiped
her eyes, he rose impulsively and moved
toward her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, look a-here now, you ain&#8217;t crying,
are you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head in indignant denial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;er&mdash;you don&#8217;t seem exactly
<a name="png.076" id="png.076"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">71</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>happy, as you might say,&rdquo; suggested
Mr. Opp, boldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m not,&rdquo; she confessed, biting her
lip. &ldquo;I oughtn&#8217;t to talk to you about it,
but there isn&#8217;t anybody here that would
understand. They think I&#8217;m stuck up
when I talk about books and music and&mdash;and
other kind of people. They just
keep on doing the same stupid things till
they get old and die. Only mother won&#8217;t
even let me do stupid things; she says I
bother her when I try to help around the
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&#8217;t you sew or make mottoes or
something?&rdquo; asked Mr. Opp, very vague
as to feminine accomplishments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s the use?&rdquo; asked the girl.
&ldquo;Mother does everything for me. She
always says she&#8217;d rather do it than
teach me how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t you take to reading?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Opp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I used to read
all the time down at school; but there
never is anything to read up here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The editor-elect peopled the country
<a name="png.077" id="png.077"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">72</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>with similar cases, and he immediately
saw himself as a public benefactor supplying
starved subscribers with a bountiful
repast of weekly news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&#8217;t you sit down?&rdquo; asked the girl,
interrupting his reflections. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t
know what can be keeping mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp looked about for a chair, but
there was none. Then he glanced at his
companion, and saw that she was holding
aside her pink skirt and evidently offering
him a seat beside her in the hammock.
He advanced a step, retreated,
then weakly capitulated. Sitting very
rigid, nursing his hat on his knees, and
inserting his forefinger between his neck
and his collar as if to breathe better, he
remarked that it was getting warmer all
the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This isn&#8217;t anything to what it will
be later,&rdquo; said the girl; &ldquo;it keeps on getting
hotter and dustier all the time. I
don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s such a stupid,
poky, little old place anywhere else in
the world. You ought to be mighty glad
you don&#8217;t live here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.078" id="png.078"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">73</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Mr. Opp cleared his throat with some
dignity. &ldquo;I expect to remain here permanent
now. I&mdash;well&mdash;the truth is, I
have decided to operate a newspaper
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried the girl, incredulously.
&ldquo;Not in the Cove!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the Cove,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Opp,
firmly. &ldquo;There&#8217;s great need here for a
live, enterprising newspaper. It&#8217;s a
virgin field, you might say. There never
was a place that needed a public voice
more. My paper is going to be a voice
that hears all sides of a question; it&#8217;s
going to appeal to the aged and the
young and all them that lies between.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be mighty grand for us!&rdquo; said
his companion, with interest. &ldquo;When is
it going to start?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Definite plans being decidedly nebulous,
Mr. Opp wisely confined himself to
generalities. He touched casually on his
remarkable fitness for the work, his wide
experience, his worldly knowledge. He
hinted that in time he expected to venture
into even deeper literary waters&mdash;poetry,
<a name="png.079" id="png.079"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">74</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and a novel, perhaps. As he
talked, he realized that for the second
time that day he was looked upon with
approval. Being accepted at his own
estimate proved a new and exhilarating
sensation.</p>

<p>It was pleasant on the wide porch,
with the honeysuckle shutting out the
sun, and the long, yellow blossoms filling
the air with fragrance. It was pleasant
to hear the contented chuckle of the hens
and the sleepy hum of the bees, and the
sound of his own voice; but most of all
it was pleasant, albeit disconcerting, to
glance sidewise occasionally and find a
pair of credulous brown eyes raised to
his in frank admiration. What if the
swing of the hammock was making him
dizzy and one foot had gone to sleep?
These were minor considerations unworthy
of mention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And just to think,&rdquo; the girl was saying,
&ldquo;that you may be right across the
road! I won&#8217;t mind staying at home so
much if you&#8217;ll let me come over and see
you make the newspaper.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.080" id="png.080"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">75</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;You might like to assist sometime,&rdquo;
said Mr. Opp, magnanimously, at the
same time cautiously removing a fluttering
pink ribbon from his knee. &ldquo;I could
let you try your hand on a wedding or a
&#8217;bituary, or something along that line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, really?&rdquo; she cried, her eyes
brightening. &ldquo;I&#8217;d just love to. I can
write compositions real nice, and you
could help me a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Opp; &ldquo;I could
learn you to do the first draft, and I
could put on the extra touches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So engrossed did they become in these
plans that they did not hear the click of
the gate, or see the small, aggressive
lady who came up the walk. She moved
with the confident air of one who is in
the habit of being obeyed. Her skirt
gave the appearance of no more daring
to hang wrong than her bonnet-strings
would have presumed to move from the
exact spot where she had tied them under
her left ear. Her small, bright eyes,
slightly crossed, apparently saw two
ways at once, for on her brief journey
<a name="png.081" id="png.081"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span

 </span>from the gate to the porch, she decapitated
two withered geraniums on the
right, and picked up a stray paper and
some dead leaves on the left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guin-never!&rdquo; she called sharply, not
seeing the couple on the porch, &ldquo;who&#8217;s
been tracking mud in on my clean
steps?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl rose hastily and came forward.
&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;here&#8217;s Mr. Opp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Gusty glanced up from one to the
other, evidently undecided how to meet
the situation. But the hesitancy was not
for long; Mr. Opp&#8217;s watch-fob, glittering
in the sunlight, symbolized such
prosperity that she hastily extended a
cordial hand of welcome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&#8217;t mean to tell me Guin-never
has been keeping you out here on
the porch instead of taking you in the
parlor? And hasn&#8217;t she given you a
thing to drink? Well, just wait till I get
my things off and I&#8217;ll fix a pitcher of
lemonade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me do it, Mother,&rdquo; said Guinevere,
eagerly; &ldquo;I often do it at school.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.082" id="png.082"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">77</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;I&#8217;d hate to drink what you make,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Gusty, waving her aside.
&ldquo;You show Mr. Opp in the parlor. No;
I&#8217;ll open the shutters: you&#8217;d get your
hands dirty.&rdquo; She bustled about with
that tyrannical capability that reduces
every one near it to a state of helpless
dependence.</p>

<p>The parlor was cool and dark, and
Mr. Opp felt around for a chair while
the refractory shutter was being opened.
When at last a shaft of light was admitted,
it fell full upon a sable frame
which hung above the horse-hair sofa,
and inclosed a glorified certificate of the
births, marriages, and deaths in the
house of Gusty. Around these written
data was a border realistically depicting
the seven ages of man and culminating
in a legend of gold which read</p>

<div class="quote">
<p class="ctr">From the Cradle to the Grave.</p>
</div>

<p>While Mr. Opp was standing before
this work of art, apparently deeply interested,
he was, in reality, peeping
through a crack in the shutter. The
<a name="png.083" id="png.083"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">78</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>sunlight was still filtering through the
honeysuckle vines, making dancing,
white patches on the porch, the bees were
humming about the blossoms, and Miss
Guinevere Gusty was still sitting in the
hammock, her chin in her palms, gazing
down the road.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Gusty returned, she bore
a glass pitcher of lemonade, a plate of
crisp gingersnaps, and a tumbler of
crushed ice, all of which rested upon a
tray which was covered with her strawberry
centerpiece, a mark of distinction
which, unfortunately, was lost upon her
guest.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp, being a man of business,
plunged at once into his subject, presenting
the matter so eloquently and using
so much more persuasion than was necessary
that he overshot the mark. Mrs.
Gusty was not without business sagacity
herself, and when Mr. Opp met a possible
objection before it had ever occurred
to her, she promptly made use of the
suggestion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, as a final
<a name="png.084" id="png.084"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">79</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>inducement, &ldquo;I&#8217;d be glad to run in some
of Mr. Gusty&#8217;s poetical pieces from time
to time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This direct appeal to her sentiment so
touched Mrs. Gusty that she suggested
they go over to the shop at once and look
it over.</p>

<p>For a moment after the door of his
future sanctum was thrown open Mr.
Opp was disconcerted. The small, dark
room, cluttered with all manner of trash,
the broken window-panes, the dust, and
the cobwebs, presented a prospect that
was far from encouraging; but after an
examination of the presses, his courage
revived.</p>

<p>After a great deal of talk on Mr. Opp&#8217;s
part, and some shrewd bargaining on
Mrs. Gusty&#8217;s, the stupendous transaction
was brought to a close, to the eminent
satisfaction of both parties.</p>

<p class="tb">It was late that night before Mr. Opp
retired. He sat in the open window of
his bedroom and looked out upon the
river. The cool night air and the quiet
<a name="png.085" id="png.085"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">80</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>light of the stars calmed the turmoil
in his brain. Gradually the colossal
schemes and the towering ambitions gave
way to an emotion to which the editor-elect
was by no means a stranger. It
was a little white-faced Fear that lurked
always in a corner of his heart, and could
be kept down only by brave words and
aggressive deeds.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">He sat with his trembling knees
hunched, and his arms awkwardly
clasped about them, an absurd atom in
the great cosmic order; yet the soul that
looked out of his squinting, wistful eyes
held all the potentialities of life, and
embodied the eternal sadness and the
eternal inspiration of human endeavor.</p>




<h2 class="chap"><a name="png.086" id="png.086"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span

<p class="start"><img class="initial" src="images/i-initial.png"
 alt="I" title="I" width="160" height="150" /><span>t</span> is no small undertaking
to embark in an untried
ship, upon unknown
waters, in the teeth of
opposing gales. But Mr.
Opp sailed the sea of life
as a valiant mariner should, self-reliant,
independent, asking advice of nobody.
He steered by the guidance of his own
peculiar moral compass, regardless of
the rough waters through which it led
him.</p>

<p>Having invested the major portion of
his savings in the present venture, it was
necessary to begin operations at once;
but events conspired to prevent him.
Miss Kippy made many demands upon
his time both by day and night; she had
transferred her affection and dependence
from her father to him, and he found
<a name="png.087" id="png.087"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">82</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>himself sorely encumbered by this new
responsibility. Moreover, the attitude
of the town toward the innovation of a
newspaper was one of frank skepticism,
and it proved a delicate and arduous task
to create the proper public sentiment.
In addition to these troubles, Mr. Opp
had a yet graver matter to hinder him:
with all his valor and energy he was suffering
qualms of uncertainty as to the
proper method of starting a weekly
journal.</p>

<p>To be sure, he had achieved a name for
the paper&mdash;a name so eminently satisfactory
that he had already had it emblazoned
upon a ream of office paper. &ldquo;The
Opp Eagle&rdquo; had sprung full-syllabled
from his teeming brain, and had been accepted
over a hundred competitors.</p>

<p>But naming the fledgling was an easy
matter compared with getting it out of
the nest; and it was not until the instalment
of his competent staff that Mr.
Opp accomplished the task.</p>

<p>This important transaction took place
one morning as he sat in his new office
<a name="png.088" id="png.088"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">83</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and struggled with his first editorial.
The bare room, with the press in the center,
served as news-room, press-room,
publication office, and editorial sanctum.
Mr. Opp sat at a new deal table, with one
pen behind his ear, and another in his
hand, and gazed for inspiration at the
brown wrapping-paper with which he
had neatly covered the walls. His mental
gymnastics were interrupted by the
appearance at the door of Miss Jim
Fenton and her brother Nick.</p>

<p>Miss Jim was an anomaly in the community,
being by theory a spinster, and
by practice a double grass-widow. Capable
and self-supporting, she attracted the
ne&#8217;er-do-wells as a magnet attracts needles,
but having been twice induced to
forego her freedom and accept the bonds
of wedlock, she had twice escaped and
reverted to her original type and name.
Miss Jim was evidently a victim of one
of Nature&#8217;s most economical moods; she
was spare and angular, with a long,
wrinkled face surmounted by a scant
fluff of pale, frizzled hair. Her mouth
<a name="png.089" id="png.089"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">84</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>slanted upward at one corner, giving her
an expression unjustly attributed to
coquetry, when in reality it was due to
an innocent and pardonable pride in an
all-gold eye-tooth.</p>

<p>But it was her clothes that brought
misunderstanding, misfortune, and even
matrimony upon Miss Jim. They were
sent her by the boxful by a cousin in the
city, and the fact was unmistakable that
they were clothes with a past. The
dresses held an atmosphere of evaporated
frivolity; flirtations lingered in every
frill, and memories of old larks lurked in
every furbelow. The hats had a jaunty
list to port, and the colored slippers still
held a dance within their soles. One old
bird of paradise on Miss Jim&#8217;s favorite
bonnet had a chronic wink for the wickedness
he had witnessed.</p>

<p>It was this wink that attracted Mr.
Opp as he looked up from his arduous
labors. For a disconcerting moment he
was uncertain whether it belonged to
Miss Jim or to the bird.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Howdy, Mr. Opp,&rdquo; said the lady in
<a name="png.090" id="png.090"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">85</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>brisk, businesslike tones. &ldquo;I was taking
a crayon portrait home to Mrs. Gusty,
and I just stopped in to see if I couldn&#8217;t
persuade you to take my brother to help
you on the newspaper. You remember
Nick, don&#8217;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp glanced up. A skeleton of a
boy, with a shaven head, was peering
eagerly past him into the office, his keen,
ferret-like eyes devouring every detail
of the printing-presses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He knows the business,&rdquo; went on
Miss Jim, anxiously pulling at the fingers
of her gloves. &ldquo;He&#8217;s been in it over a
year at Coreyville. He wants to go
back; but I ain&#8217;t willing till he gets
stronger. He ain&#8217;t been up but two
weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp turned impressively in his revolving
chair, the one luxury which he
had deemed indispensable, and doubtfully
surveyed the applicant. The mere
suggestion of his leaning upon this
broken reed seemed ridiculous; yet the
boy&#8217;s thin, sallow face, and Miss Jim&#8217;s
imploring eyes, caused him to hesitate.</p>

<p><a name="png.091" id="png.091"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">86</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; he said, with thumbs
together and his lips pursed, after the
manner of the various employers before
whom he had stood in the past, &ldquo;we are
just making a preliminary start, and we
haven&#8217;t engaged our staff yet. I am a
business man and a careful one. I
don&#8217;t feel justified in going to no extra
expense until &lsquo;The Opp Eagle&rsquo; is, in a
way, on its feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&#8217;s all right,&rdquo; said the boy;
&ldquo;I&#8217;ll work a month for nothing. Lots
of fellows do that on the big papers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Jim plucked warningly at his
sleeve, and Mr. Opp, seeing that Nick&#8217;s
enthusiasm had led him beyond his
depth, went gallantly to the rescue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he said hastily; &ldquo;that
ain&#8217;t my policy. I think I might contrive
to pay you a small, reasonable sum
down, and increase it in ratio as the
paper become more prosperous. Don&#8217;t
you think you better sit down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; I&#8217;m all right,&rdquo; said the boy,
impatiently. &ldquo;I can do &#8217;most anything
about a paper, setting type, printing,
<a name="png.092" id="png.092"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">87</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>reporting, collecting, &#8217;most anything you
put me at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such timely knowledge, in whatever
guise it came, seemed Heaven-sent. Mr.
Opp gave a sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you feel that you can&#8217;t do any better
than accepting the small sum that
just at present I&#8217;ll have to offer you,
why, I think we can come to some arrangement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s mighty nice in you,&rdquo; said
Miss Jim, jerking her head forward in
order to correct an undue backward
gravitation of her bonnet. &ldquo;If ever you
want a crayon portrait, made from life
or enlarged from a photograph, I&#8217;ll
make you a special price on it. I&#8217;m just
taking this here one home to Mrs. Gusty;
she had it done for Guin-never&#8217;s birthday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Jim removed the wrappings and
disclosed a portrait of Miss Guinevere
Gusty, very large as to eyes and very
small as to mouth. She handed it to Mr.
Opp, and called attention to its fine qualities.</p>

<p><a name="png.093" id="png.093"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">88</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Just look at the lace on that dress!
Mrs. Fallows picked a whole pattern off
on her needles from one of my portraits.
And did you notice the eyelashes; you
can actually count &#8217;em! She had four
buttons on her dress, but I didn&#8217;t get in
but three; but I ain&#8217;t going to mention it
to Mrs. Gusty. Don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s
pretty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp, who had been smiling absently
at the portrait, started guiltily.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said confusedly; &ldquo;yes,
ma&#8217;am, I think she is.&rdquo; Then he felt a
curious tingling about his ears and realized,
to his consternation, that he was
blushing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&#8217;s too droopin&#8217; a type for me,&rdquo;
said Miss Jim, removing an ostrich tip
from her angle of vision; then she continued
in a side whisper: &ldquo;Say, would
you mind making Nick take this bottle
of milk at twelve o&#8217;clock, and resting a
little? He ain&#8217;t as strong as he lets on,
and he has sort of sinking spells &#8217;long
about noon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Receiving the bottle thus surreptitiously
<a name="png.094" id="png.094"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">89</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>offered, and assisting the lady to
gather up her bundles, Mr. Opp bowed
her out, and turned to face the embarrassing
necessity of giving instructions
to his new employee. He was relieved
to find, however, that the young gentleman
in question possessed initiative; for
Nick had promptly removed his coat, and
fallen to work, putting things to rights
with an energy and ability that caused
Mr. Opp to offer up a prayer of heartfelt
gratitude.</p>

<p>All the morning they worked silently,
Mr. Opp toiling over his editorial, with
constant references to a small dictionary
which he concealed in the drawer of
the table, and Nick giving the presses
a thorough and much-needed overhauling.</p>

<p>At the noon-hour they shared their
lunch, and Mr. Opp, firm in the authority
invested in him by Miss Jim, demanded
that Nick should drink his milk, and recline
at length upon the office bench for
twenty minutes. It was with great difficulty
that Nick was persuaded to submit
<a name="png.095" id="png.095"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">90</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to this transferred coddling; but he evidently
realized that insubordination at
the start of his career would be fatal,
and, moreover, his limbs ached and his
hands trembled.</p>

<p>It was in the intimacy of this, their
first, staff meal, that they discussed the
policy of the paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, &ldquo;we have
got a vast undertaking in front of us.
For the next few months we won&#8217;t
scarcely have time to draw a natural
breath. I am going to put every faculty
I own on to making &lsquo;The Opp Eagle&rsquo; a
fine paper. I expect to get here at seven
o&#8217;clock <span class="allsc">A.M.</span>, and continue to pursue my
work as far into the midnight hours as
may need be. Nothing in the way of
pleasure or anything else is going to pervert
my attention. Of course you understand
that my mind will be taken up with
the larger issues of things, and I&#8217;ll have
to risk a dependence on you to attend to
the smaller details.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Nick, gratefully;
&ldquo;you won&#8217;t be sorry you trusted me,
<a name="png.096" id="png.096"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">91</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Mr. Opp. I&#8217;ll do my level best. When
will we get out the first issue?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;er&mdash;the truth is,&rdquo; said Mr.
Opp, &ldquo;I haven&#8217;t, as you might say, accumulated
sufficient of material as yet.
You see, I have a great many irons in
the fire, and besides opening up this
office, I am the president of a company
that&#8217;s just bought up twenty acres of
ground around here. The biggest oil
proposition&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; interrupted Nick; &ldquo;but
don&#8217;t you think we could get started in
two weeks, with the ads and the contributors&#8217;
letters from other counties,
and a story or two I could run in, and
your editorial page?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve got two advertisements,&rdquo; said
Mr. Opp; &ldquo;but I don&#8217;t intend to rest
content until every man in the Cove has
got a card in. Now, about these contributors
from other counties?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can manage that,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;I&#8217;ll
write to some girl or fellow I know in
the different towns, and ask them to give
me a weekly letter. They sign
<a name="png.097" id="png.097"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">92</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>themselves &lsquo;Gipsy&rsquo; or &lsquo;Fairy&rsquo; or &lsquo;Big Injun&rsquo;
or something like that, and tell what&#8217;s
doing in their neighborhood. We&#8217;ll have
to fix the letters up some, but they help
fill in like everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp&#8217;s spirits rose at this capable
coöperation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;er&mdash;like the name?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Opp Eagle&rsquo;?&rdquo; said Nick.
&ldquo;Bully!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such unqualified approval went to
Mr. Opp&#8217;s head, and he rashly broke
through the dignity that should hedge
about an editor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t mind reading you some of my
editorial,&rdquo; he said urbanely; &ldquo;it&#8217;s the
result of considerable labor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He opened the drawer and took out
some loosely written pages, though he
knew each paragraph by heart. Squaring
himself in his revolving-chair, and clearing
his throat, he addressed himself ostensibly
to the cadaverous youth stretched
at length before him, but in imagination
to all the southern counties of the grand
old Commonwealth of Kentucky.</p>

<p><a name="png.098" id="png.098"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">93</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>His various business experiences had
stored such an assorted lot of information
in his brain that it was not unlike a
country store in the diversity of its contents.
His style, like his apparel, was
more ornate and pretentious than what
lay beneath it. There were many words
which he knew by sight, but with which
he had no speaking acquaintance. But
Mr. Opp had ideals, and this was the first
opportunity he had ever had to put them
before his fellow-men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The great bird of American Liberty,&rdquo;
he read impressively, &ldquo;has soared
and flown over the country and lighted
at last in your midst. &lsquo;The Opp Eagle&rsquo;
appears for the first time to-day. It is
no money scheme in which we are indulging;
we aim first and foremost to fulfil
a much-needed want in the community.
&lsquo;The Opp Eagle&rsquo; will tell the people what
you want to know better and at less expense
than any other method. It will
aim at bringing the priceless gems of
knowledge within the reach of
<a name="png.099" id="png.099"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">94</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>everybody. For what is bread to the body if
you do not also clothe the mind spiritually
and mentally?</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will boom this, our native, city.
If possible, I hope to get the streets
cleaned up and a railroad, and mayhap
in time lamp-posts. This region has ever
been known for its great and fine natural
resources, but we have been astounded,
you might say astonished, in recent visits
to see its naked and crude immensities,
which far exceeds our most sanguine expectations.
So confident are we that a
few of our most highly respectable citizens
have, at the instigation of the Editor
of &lsquo;The Opp Eagle,&rsquo; bought up the land
lying between Turtle Creek and the
river, and as soon as a little more capital
has been accumulated, intend to open up
a oil proposition that will astonish the
eyes of the natives!</p>

<p>&ldquo;In all candor, we truly believe this
favored region of ours to have no equal
in underground wealth nowhere upon
this terrestrial earth, albeit we are not
of globe-trotter stock nor tribe. We will
<a name="png.100" id="png.100"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">95</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>endeavor to induce the home people to
copy after the wise example of a few of
our leading citizens and buy up oil rights
before the kings of Bonanzas from the
Metropolitan cities discover our treasure
and wrench it from our grasp. &lsquo;The Opp
Eagle&rsquo; will, moreover, stand for temperance
and reform. We will hurl grape
and cannister into the camps of the
saloonatics until they flee the wrath to
come. Will also publish a particular
statement of all social entertainments,
including weddings, parties, church
socials, and funerals. In conclusion,
would say that we catch this first opportunity
to thank you in collective manner
herein for the welcome you have ordained
&lsquo;The Opp Eagle.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp came to a close and waited
for applause; nor was he disappointed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee! I wish I could write like that!&rdquo;
said Nick, rising on his elbow. &ldquo;I can
do the printing all right, and hustle
around for the news; but I never know
how to put on the trimmings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp laid a hand upon his shoulder;
<a name="png.101" id="png.101"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">96</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>he was fast developing a fondness
for the youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s a gift,&rdquo; he said sympathetically,
&ldquo;that I am afraid, my boy, nobody can&#8217;t
learn you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I come in?&rdquo; said a voice from
outside, and Mr. Gallop peeped around
the open door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walk in,&rdquo; cried Mr. Opp, while Nick
sprang to his feet. &ldquo;We are just by way
of finishing up the work at hand, and
have a few minutes of spare leisure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just wanted to know if you&#8217;d help
us get up a town band,&rdquo; said Mr. Gallop.
&ldquo;I told the boys you&#8217;d be too busy, but
they made me come. I asked Mr. Fallows
if you was musical; but I wouldn&#8217;t
repeat what he said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jimmy is just naturally humoristic,&rdquo;
said Mr. Opp. &ldquo;Go along and tell
me what he remarked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Gallop, indignantly,
&ldquo;he said you was a expert on the windpipe!
Mr. Tucker, I believe it was,
thought you used to play the accordion.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.102" id="png.102"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">97</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp; &ldquo;it was the cornet.
I was considerable of a performer
at one time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we want you for the leader of
our band,&rdquo; said Mr. Gallop. &ldquo;We are
going to have blue uniforms and give
regular concerts up on Main Street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick Fenny began searching for a
pencil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; went on Mr. Gallop,
rapidly, &ldquo;the last show boat that was
here had a calliope, and there&#8217;s another
one coming next week. All I have to do
is to hear a tune twice, then I can play it.
Miss Guin-never Gusty is going up to
Coreyville next week, and she says she&#8217;ll
get us some new pieces. She&#8217;s going to
select a plush self-rocker for the congregation
to give the new preacher.
They&#8217;re keeping it awful secret, but I
heard &#8217;em mention it over the telephone.
The preacher&#8217;s baby has been mighty
sick, and so has his mother, up at the
Ridge; but she&#8217;s got well again. Well,
I must go along now. Ain&#8217;t it warm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before Mr. Opp had ceased showing
<a name="png.103" id="png.103"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">98</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Mr. Gallop out, his attention was arrested
by the strange conduct of his
staff. That indefatigable youth was
writing furiously on the new wall-paper,
covering the clean brown surface with
large, scrawling characters.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp&#8217;s indignation was checked at
its source by the radiant face which Nick
turned upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve got another column!&rdquo; he cried;
&ldquo;listen here:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A new and handsome Show Boat
will tie up at the Cove the early part of
next week. A fine calliope will be on
board.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Miss Guinevere Gusty will visit
friends in Coreyville soon.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The new preacher will be greatly
surprised soon by the gift of a fine plush
rocking-chair from the ladies of the congregation.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The infant baby of the new preacher
has been sick, but is better some.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jimmy Fallows came near getting
an undertaking job at the Ridge last
week, but the lady got well.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.104" id="png.104"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">99</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;And that ain&#8217;t all,&rdquo; he continued excitedly;
&ldquo;I&#8217;m going out now to get all
the particulars about that band, and
we&#8217;ll have a long story about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp, left alone in his office, made
an unsuccessful effort to resume work.
The fluttering of the &ldquo;Eagle&#8217;s&rdquo; wings
preparatory to taking flight was not the
only thing that interfered with his power
of concentration. He did not at all like
the way he felt. Peculiar symptoms had
developed in the last week, and the
quinine which he had taken daily had
failed to relieve him. He could not say
that he was sick,&mdash;in fact, he had never
been in better health,&mdash;but there was a
strange feeling of restlessness, a vague
disturbance of his innermost being, that
annoyed and puzzled him. Even as he
tried to solve the problem, an irresistible
impulse brought him to his feet and carried
him to the door. Miss Guinevere
Gusty was coming out of her gate in a
soft, white muslin, and a chip hat laden
with pink roses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything I can do for you up
<a name="png.105" id="png.105"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">100</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>street?&rdquo; she called across pleasantly to
Mr. Opp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, thank you&mdash;no, the fact is&mdash;well,
you see, I find it necessary for me
to go up myself.&rdquo; Mr. Opp heard himself
saying these words with great surprise,
and when he found himself actually
walking out of the office, leaving a large
amount of unfinished work, his indignation
knew no bounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sun is awful hot. Ain&#8217;t you
goin&#8217; to wear a hat?&rdquo; drawled Miss
Guinevere.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp put his hand to his head in
some embarrassment, and then assured
her that he very often went without it.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">They sauntered slowly down the dusty
road. On one side the trees hedged them
in, but on the other stretched wide fields
of tasseled corn over which shimmered
waves of summer heat. White butterflies
fluttered constantly across their
path, and overhead, hidden somewhere
in the branches, the birds kept up a constant
song. The August sun, still high
in the heavens, shone fiercely down on
<a name="png.106" id="png.106"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">101</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the open road, on the ragweed by the
wayside, on the black-eyed Susans nodding
at the light; but it fell most mercilessly
of all upon the bald spot on the
head of the unconscious Mr. Opp, who
was moving, as in an hypnotic state, into
the land of romance.</p>



<h2 class="chap"><a name="png.107" id="png.107"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">102</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>VIII</h2>



<p class="start"><img class="initial" src="images/b-initial.png"
 alt="B" title="B" width="156" height="150" /><span>y</span> all the laws of physics,
Mr. Opp during the
months that ensued,
should have stood perfectly
still. For if ever
two forces pulled with
equal strength in opposite directions,
love and ambition did in the heart of our
friend the editor. But Mr. Opp did not
stand still; on the contrary, he seemed
to be moving in every direction at once.</p>

<p>In due time &ldquo;The Opp Eagle&rdquo; made
its initial flight, and received the approbation
of the community. The first page
was formal, containing the editorial, a
list of the subscribers, a notice to tax-payers,
and three advertisements, one
of which requested &ldquo;the lady public to
please note that the hats put out by Miss
Duck Brown do not show the wire composing
the frame.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.108" id="png.108"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">103</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>But the first page of the &ldquo;Eagle&rdquo; was
like the front door of a house: when once
you got on the other side of it, you were
in the family, as it were, formality was
dropped, and an easy atmosphere of familiarity
prevailed. You read that Uncle
Enoch Siller had Sundayed over at the
Ridge, or that Aunt Gussy Williams was
on the puny list, and frequently there
were friendly references to &ldquo;Ye Editor&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Ye Quill Driver,&rdquo; for after soaring
to dizzy heights in his editorials, Mr.
Opp condescended to come down on the
second page and move in and out of the
columns, as a host among his guests.</p>

<p>It is painful to reflect what would
have been the fate of the infatuated Mr.
Opp in these days had it not been for the
faithful Nick. Nick&#8217;s thirst for work
was insatiable; he yearned for responsibility,
and was never so happy as when
gathering news. He chased an item as
a dog might chase a rat, first scenting it,
then hunting it down, and after mutilating
it a bit, proudly returning it to his
master.</p>

<p><a name="png.109" id="png.109"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">104</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Mr. Opp was enabled, by this competent
assistance, to spare many a half-hour
in consultation with Miss Guinevere
Gusty concerning the reportorial work
she was going to do on the paper. The
fact that nobody died or got married delayed
all actual performance, but in
order to be ready for the emergency,
frequent calls were deemed expedient.</p>

<p>It became part of the day&#8217;s program
to read her his editorial, or consult her
about some social item, or to report a
new subscriber, his self-esteem meanwhile
putting forth all manner of new
shoots and bursting into exotic bloom
under the warmth of her approval.</p>

<p>Miss Gusty, on her part, was acquiring
a new interest in her surroundings.
In addition to the subtle flattery of being
consulted, she was the recipient of daily
offerings of books, and music, and drugstore
candy, and sometimes a handful of
flowers, carefully concealed in a newspaper
to escape the vigilant eye of Jimmy
Fallows.</p>

<p>On several occasions she returned Mr.
<a name="png.110" id="png.110"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">105</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Opp&#8217;s calls, picking her way daintily
across the road, and peeping in at the
window to make sure he was there.</p>

<p>It was at such times that the staff of
&ldquo;The Opp Eagle&rdquo; misconducted itself.
It objected to a young woman in the
press-room; it disapproved of the said
person sitting at the deal table in confidential
conversation with the editor; it
saw no humor in her dipping the pencils
into the ink-well, and scrawling names
on the new office stationery; and when
the point was reached that she moved
about the office, asking absurd questions
and handling the type, the staff could no
longer endure it, but hastened forth to
forget its annoyance in the pursuit of
business.</p>

<p>Moreover, the conduct of the chief, as
Nick was pleased to call Mr. Opp, was
becoming more and more peculiar. He
would arrive in the morning, his pockets
bristling with papers, and his mind with
projects. He would attack the work of
the day with ferocious intensity, then in
the midst of it, without warning, he
<a name="png.111" id="png.111"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">106</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>would lapse into an apparent trance, his
hands in his pockets, his eyes on the ceiling,
and such a smile on his face as one
usually reserves for a camera.</p>

<p>Nick did not know that it was the song
of the siren that was calling Mr. Opp,
who, instead of lashing himself to the
mast and steering for the open sea, was
letting his little craft drift perilously
near the rocky coast.</p>

<p>No feature of the proceedings was lost
upon Mrs. Gusty. She applied the same
method to her daughter that she did to
her vines, tying her firmly to the wall of
her own ability, and prescribing the direction
and length to which she should
grow. The situation would need pruning
later, but for the present she studied
conditions and bided her time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the &ldquo;Eagle&rdquo; was circling
more widely in its flight. Mr. Opp&#8217;s persistent
and eloquent articles pertaining
to the great oil wealth of the region had
been reinforced by a favorable report
from the laboratory in the city to which
he had sent a specimen from the spring
<a name="png.112" id="png.112"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">107</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>on Turtle Creek. Thus equipped with
wings of hope, and a small ballast of
fact, the &ldquo;Eagle&rdquo; went soaring on its
way, and in time attracted the attention
of a party of capitalists who were traveling
through the State, investigating oil
and mineral possibilities.</p>

<p>One epoch-making day, the editor was
called up over the long-distance telephone,
and, after answering numerous
inquiries, was told that the party expected
to spend the following night in
the Cove.</p>

<p>This important event took place the
last of November, and threw the town
into great excitement. Mr. Opp received
the message early in the morning, and
immediately set to work to call a meeting
of the Turtle Creek Land Company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This here is one of the most critical
moments in the history of Cove City,&rdquo;
he announced excitedly to Nick. &ldquo;It&#8217;s
a most fortunate thing that they&#8217;ve got
me here to make the preliminary arrangements,
and to sort of get the thing
solidified, as you might say. I&#8217;ll call a
<a name="png.113" id="png.113"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">108</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>meeting for eleven o&#8217;clock at Your Hotel.
You call up old man Hager and the
preacher, and I will undertake to notify
Jimmy Fallows and Mr. Tucker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The preacher ain&#8217;t in town; he&#8217;s out
at Smither&#8217;s Ridge, marrying a couple.
I got the whole notice written out beforehand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, tear it up,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp.
&ldquo;I&#8217;ve engaged a special hand to do all
weddings and funerals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick looked hurt; this was the first
time his kingdom had been invaded. He
kicked the door sullenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&#8217;t get the preacher if he&#8217;s out
at Smither&#8217;s Ridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nick,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, equally hurt,
&ldquo;is that the way for a subordinate reporter
to talk to a&#8217; editor? You don&#8217;t
seem to realize that this here is a very
serious and large transaction. There
may be hundreds of dollars involved.
It&#8217;s a&#8217; awful weight of responsibility
for one man. I&#8217;m willing to finance it
and conduct the main issues, but I&#8217;ve
got to have the backing of all the other
<a name="png.114" id="png.114"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">109</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>parties. Now it&#8217;s with you whether the
preacher gets there or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I hunt up Mat Lucas, too?&rdquo;
asked Nick as he started forth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; that&#8217;s my branch of the work:
but&mdash;say&mdash;Nick, your sister will have to
be there; she owns some shares.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Nick; &ldquo;her buggy is
hitched up in front of Tucker&#8217;s. I&#8217;ll tell
her to wait till you come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp was not long in following.
He walked down the road with an important
stride, his bosom scarcely able to
accommodate the feeling of pride and
responsibility that swelled it. He was in
a position of trust; his fellow-citizens
would look to him, a man of larger experience
and business ability, to deal with
these moneyed strangers. He would be
fair, but shrewd. He knew the clever
wiles of the capitalists; he would meet
them with calm but unyielding dignity.</p>

<p>It was in this mood that he came upon
Miss Jim, who was in the act of disentangling
a long lace scarf from her
buggy whip. Her flushed face and flashing
<a name="png.115" id="png.115"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">110</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>eyes gave such unmistakable signs
of wrath that Mr. Opp glanced apprehensively
at the whip in her hand, and
then at Jimmy Fallows, who was hitching
her horse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Howdy, Mr. Opp,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&#8217;s
a pleasure to meet a gentleman, after
what I&#8217;ve seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, &ldquo;that our
friend here ain&#8217;t been indulging in his
customary&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain&#8217;t Mr. Fallows,&rdquo; she broke in
sharply; &ldquo;it&#8217;s Mr. Tucker. He ain&#8217;t got
the feeling of a broomstick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Miss Jim,&rdquo; began Jimmy Fallows
in a teasing tone; but the lady
turned her back upon him and addressed
Mr. Opp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see this portrait,&rdquo; she said angrily,
pulling it out from under the seat.
&ldquo;It took me four weeks, including two
Sunday afternoons, to make it. I begun
it the second week after Mrs. Tucker
died, when I seen him takin&#8217; on so hard
at church. He was cryin&#8217; so when they
took up the collection that he never even
<a name="png.116" id="png.116"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">111</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>seen the plate pass him. I went right
home and set to work on this here portrait,
thinking he&#8217;d be glad and willing
to buy it from me. Wouldn&#8217;t you, if you
was a widower?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp gazed doubtfully at the picture,
which represented Mr. Tucker sitting
disconsolately beside a grave, with
a black-bordered handkerchief held
lightly between his fingers. A weeping-willow
drooped above him, and on the
tombstone at his side were two angels
supporting the initials of the late Mrs.
Tucker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Miss Jim,&rdquo; insisted Fallows,
&ldquo;you&#8217;re askin&#8217; too much of old man
Tucker to expect him to keep on seein&#8217; a
tombstone when he&#8217;s got one eye on you
and one eye on the Widow Gusty. He
ain&#8217;t got any hair on top of his head to
part, but he&#8217;s took to partin&#8217; it down
the back, and I seen him Sunday trying
to read the hymns without his spectacles.
He started up on &lsquo;Let a Little Sunshine
In&rsquo; when they was singing &lsquo;Come, ye
Disconsolate.&rsquo; You rub out the face and
<a name="png.117" id="png.117"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">112</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the initials on that there picture and
keep it for the nex&#8217; widower. Ketch him
when he&#8217;s still droopin&#8217;. You&#8217;ll get
your money back. Your mistake was in
waiting too long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speaking of waiting,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp,
impatiently, &ldquo;there&#8217;s a call meeting of
the Turtle Creek Land Co. for this morning
at eleven at Your Hotel. Hope it&#8217;s
convenient, Jimmy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Jimmy; &ldquo;we got more
empty chairs at Your Hotel than anything
else. What&#8217;s the meeting for?
Struck gold?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp imparted the great news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my land!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Jim,
&ldquo;will they be here to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not until to-morrow night,&rdquo; explained
Mr. Opp. &ldquo;This here meeting
this morning is for the stock-holders
only. We got to kinder outline our policy
and arrange a sort of basis of operation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Miss Jim, &ldquo;I&#8217;ll take the
portrait up to Mrs. Gusty&#8217;s and ask her
to take care of it for me. I don&#8217;t know
<a name="png.118" id="png.118"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">113</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>as I can do the face over into somebody
else&#8217;s, but I can&#8217;t afford to lose it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was afternoon before the stock-holders
could all be brought together.
They assembled in the office of Your Hotel
in varying states of mind ranging
from frank skepticism to intense enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Mr. Tucker represented the conservative
element. He was the rich man of
the town, with whom economy, at first a
necessity, had become a luxury. No
greater proof could have been desired of
Mr. Opp&#8217;s persuasive powers than that
Mr. Tucker had invested in a hundred
shares of the new stock. He sat on the
edge of his chair, wizen, anxious, fidgety,
loaded with objections, and ready to go
off half-cocked. Old man Hager sat in
his shadow, objecting when he objected,
voting as he voted, and prepared to
loosen or tighten his purse-strings as
Mr. Tucker suggested.</p>

<p>Mat Lucas and Miss Jim were independents.
They had both had sufficient
experience in business to know their own
<a name="png.119" id="png.119"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">114</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>minds. If there was any money to be
made in the Cove or about it, they intended
to have a part in it.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp and the preacher constituted
the Liberal party. They furnished the
enthusiasm that floated the scheme. They
were able to project themselves into the
future and prophesy dazzling probabilities.</p>

<p>Jimmy Fallows, alone of the group,
maintained an artistic attitude toward
the situation. He was absolutely detached.
He sat with his chair tilted
against the door and his thumbs in his
armholes, and treated the whole affair
as a huge joke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The matter up for immediate consideration,&rdquo;
Mr. Opp was saying impressively,
&ldquo;is whether these here gentlemen
should want to buy us out, we would sell,
or whether we would remain firm in possession,
and let them lease our ground
and share the profits on the oil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&#8217;m kinder in favor of selling
out if we get the chance,&rdquo; urged Mr.
Tucker in a high, querulous voice. &ldquo;To
<a name="png.120" id="png.120"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">115</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>sell on a rising market is always a pretty
good plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After we run up ag&#8217;in&#8217; them city fellows,&rdquo;
said Mat Lucas, &ldquo;I&#8217;ll be surprised
if we git as much out as we put
in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; protested Mr. Opp,
&ldquo;this here ain&#8217;t the attitude to assume
to the affair. To my profoundest belief
there is a fortune in these here lands.
The establishment of &lsquo;The Opp Eagle&rsquo;
has, as you know, been a considerable
tax on my finances, but everything else
I&#8217;ve got has gone into this company.
It&#8217;s a great and glorious opportunity,
one that I been predicting and prophesying
for these many years. Are we going
to sell out to this party, and let them
reap the prize? No; I trust and hope
that such is not the case. In order to
have more capital to open up the mines,
I advocate the taking of them in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bet they been advocating the taking
of us in,&rdquo; chuckled Jimmy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear friends, suppose we
vote on it,&rdquo; suggested the preacher.</p>

<p><a name="png.121" id="png.121"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">116</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Reach yer hand back there in the
press, Mr. Opp, and git the lead-pencil,&rdquo;
said Jimmy, without moving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The motion before the house,&rdquo; said
Mr. Opp, &ldquo;is whether we will sell out or
take &#8217;em in. All in favor say &lsquo;Aye.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a unanimous vote in the
affirmative, although each member interpreted
the motion in his own way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, briskly;
&ldquo;the motion is carried. Now we got to
arrange about entertaining the party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Tucker, whose brain was an accommodation
stopping at each station,
was still struggling with the recent motion
when this new thought about entertainment
whizzed past. The instinct of
the landlord awoke at the call, and he
promptly switched off the main line and
went down the side track.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gallop was here while ago,&rdquo; Jimmy
was saying, with a satisfied glance at
Mr. Tucker; &ldquo;said they wanted me to
take keer of &#8217;em. I&#8217;ll &#8217;commodate all
but the preachers. If there are any
preachers, Mr. Tucker kin have &#8217;em. I
<a name="png.122" id="png.122"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">117</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>have to draw the line somewheres. I
can&#8217;t stand &#8217;em &lsquo;Brother-Fallowsing&rsquo;
me. Last time the old woman corralled
one and brought him home, he was as
glad to find me to work on as she&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217;
be&#8217;n to git some fruit to preserve.
&lsquo;Brother,&rsquo; he says, reaching out for my
hand, &lsquo;do you ever think about the awful
place you are going to when you die?&rsquo;
&lsquo;You bet,&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;I got more friends
there than anywhere.&rsquo;&rdquo; And Jimmy&#8217;s
laugh shook the stove-pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many gentlemen are coming to-morrow?&rdquo;
asked Miss Jim, who was sitting
in a corner as far as possible from
Mr. Tucker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten,&rdquo; said Jimmy. &ldquo;Now, you
wouldn&#8217;t think it, but this here hotel has
got six bedrooms. I&#8217;ve tooken care of
as many as twenty at a time, easy, but
I&#8217;ll be hanged if I ever heard of such
foolishness as every one of these fellers
wantin&#8217; a room to hisself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve got three rooms empty,&rdquo; said
Mr. Tucker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that leaves one over,&rdquo; said Mat
<a name="png.123" id="png.123"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">118</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Lucas. &ldquo;I&#8217;d take him out home, but
we&#8217;ve got company, and are sleeping
three in a bed now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp hesitated; then his hospitality
overcame his discretion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just consider him my guest,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I&#8217;ll be very pleased to provide
entertainment for the gentleman in question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not until the business of the day was
over, and Mr. Opp was starting home,
did he realize how tired he was. It was
not his duties as an editor, or even as a
promoter, that were telling on him; it
was his domestic affairs that preyed
upon his mind. For Mr. Opp not only
led a strenuous life by day, but by night
as well. Miss Kippy&#8217;s day began with
his coming home, and ended in the morning
when he went away; the rest of the
time she waited.</p>

<p>Just now the problem that confronted
him was the entertainment of the expected
guest. Never, since he could remember,
had a stranger invaded that
little world where Miss Kippy lived her
<a name="png.124" id="png.124"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">119</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>unreal life of dreams. What effect would
it have upon her? Would it be kinder to
hide her away as something he was
ashamed of, or to let her appear and run
the risk of exposing her deficiency to uncaring
eyes? During the months that he
had watched her, a fierce tenderness had
sprung up in his heart. He had become
possessed of the hope that she might be
rescued from her condition. Night after
night he patiently tried to teach her to
read and to write, stopping again and
again to humor her whims and indulge
her foolish fancies. More than once he
had surprised a new look in her eyes, a
sudden gleam of sanity, of frightened
understanding; and at such times she
would cling to him for protection against
that strange thing that was herself.</p>

<p>As he trudged along, deep in thought,
a white chrysanthemum fell at his feet.
Looking up, he discovered Miss Guinevere
Gusty, in a red cloak and hat, sitting
on the bank with a band-box in her
lap.</p>

<p>His troubles were promptly swallowed
<a name="png.125" id="png.125"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">120</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>up in the heart-quake which ensued; but
his speech was likewise, and he stood
foolishly opening and shutting his
mouth, unable to effect a sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am waiting for the packet to go
down to Coreyville,&rdquo; announced Miss
Gusty, straightening her plumed hat,
and smiling. &ldquo;Mr. Gallop says it&#8217;s an
hour late; but I don&#8217;t care, it&#8217;s such a
grand day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp removed his eyes long enough
to direct an inquiring glance at the
heavens and the earth. &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; he
asked, finding his voice. &ldquo;I been so occupied
with business that I haven&#8217;t
scarcely taken occasion to note the
weather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&#8217;s all soft and warm, just
like spring,&rdquo; she continued, holding out
her arms and looking up at the sky.
&ldquo;I&#8217;ve been wishing I had time to walk
along the river a piece.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll take you,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp,
eagerly. &ldquo;We can hear the whistle of
the boat in amply sufficient time to get
back. Besides, it is a hour late.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.126" id="png.126"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">121</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>She hesitated. &ldquo;You&#8217;re real sure you
can get me back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;I might
say in all my experience I never have yet
got a lady left on a boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Guinevere, used to being guided,
handed him her band-box, and followed
him up the steep bank.</p>

<p>The path wound in and out among the
trees, now losing itself in the woods, now
coming out upon the open river. The
whole world was a riot of crimson and
gold, and it was warm with that soft
echo of summer that brings some of its
sweetness, and all of its sadness, but
none of its mirth.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp walked beside his divinity
oblivious to all else. The sunlight fell
unnoticed except when it lay upon her
face; the only breeze that blew from
heaven was the one that sent a stray curl
floating across her cheek. As Mr. Opp
walked, he talked, putting forth every
effort to please. His burning desire to
be worthy of her led him into all manner
of verbal extravagances, and the mere
<a name="png.127" id="png.127"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">122</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>fact that she was taller than he caused
him to indulge in more lofty and figurative
language. He captured fugitive
quotations, evolved strange metaphors,
coined words, and poured all in a glittering
heap of eloquence before her shrine.</p>

<p>As he talked, his companion moved
heedlessly along beside him, stopping
now and then to gather a spray of goldenrod,
or to gaze absently at the river
through some open space in the trees.
For Miss Guinevere Gusty lived in a
world of her own&mdash;a world of vague possibilities,
of half-defined longings, and
intangible dreams. Love was still an abstract
sentiment, something radiant and
breathless that might envelop her at any
moment and bear her away to Elysium.</p>

<p>As she stooped to free her skirt from
a detaining thorn, she pointed down the
bank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&#8217;s some pretty sweet-gum
leaves; I wish they weren&#8217;t so far
down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Opp, rashly
eager to prove his gallantry.</p>

<p><a name="png.128" id="png.128"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">123</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;&#8217;Way down over the edge; but you
mustn&#8217;t go, it&#8217;s too steep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for me,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, plunging
boldly through the underbrush.</p>

<p>The tree grew at a sharp angle over
the water, and the branches were so far
up that it was necessary to climb out a
short distance in order to reach them.
Mr. Opp&#8217;s soul was undoubtedly that of
a knight-errant, but his body, alas! was
not. When he found himself astride the
slender, swaying trunk, with the bank
dropping sharply to the river flowing
dizzily beneath him, he went suddenly
and unexpectedly blind. Between admiration
for himself for ever having gotten
there, and despair of ever getting
back, lay the present necessity of loosening
his hold long enough to break off a
branch of the crimson leaves. He tried
opening one eye, but the effect was so
terrifying that he promptly closed it.
He pictured himself, a few moments before,
strolling gracefully along the road
conversing brilliantly upon divers subjects;
then he bitterly considered the
<a name="png.129" id="png.129"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">124</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>present moment and the effect he must
be producing upon the young lady in the
red cloak on the path above. He saw
himself clinging abjectly to the swaying
tree-trunk, only waiting for his strength
or the tree to give away, before he should
be plunged into the waters below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s a pretty spray,&rdquo; called the
soft voice from above; &ldquo;that one above,
to the left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp, rallying all his courage,
reached blindly out in the direction indicated,
and as he did so, he realized that
annihilation was imminent. Demonstrating
a swift geometrical figure in the air,
he felt himself hurling through space,
coming to an abrupt and awful pause
when he struck the earth. Perceiving
with a thrill of surprise that he was still
alive, he cautiously opened his eyes. To
his further amazement he found that he
had landed on his feet, unhurt, and that
in his left hand he held a long branch of
sweet-gum leaves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you skinned the cat, didn&#8217;t
you?&rdquo; called an admiring voice from
<a name="png.130" id="png.130"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">125</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>above. &ldquo;I was just wondering how you
was ever going to get down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp crawled up the slippery bank,
his knees trembling so that he could
scarcely stand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, as he handed her the
leaves; &ldquo;those kind of athletic acts seem
to just come natural to some people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be awful strong,&rdquo; continued
Guinevere, looking at him with approval.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp sank beside her on the bank
and gave himself up to the full enjoyment
of the moment. Both hands were
badly bruised, and he had a dim misgiving
that his coat was ripped up the back;
but he was happy, with the wild, reckless
happiness of one to whom Fate has been
unexpectedly kind. Moreover, the goal
toward which all his thought had been
rushing for the past hour was in sight.
He could already catch glimpses of the
vision beautiful. He could hear himself
storming the citadel with magic words
of eloquence. Meanwhile he nursed the
band-box and smiled dumbly into space.</p>

<p><a name="png.131" id="png.131"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">126</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>From far below, the pungent odor of
burning leaves floated up, and the air
was full of a blue haze that became
luminous as the sun transfused it. It
enveloped the world in mystery, and
threw a glamour over the dying day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s so pretty it hurts,&rdquo; said the girl,
clasping her hands about her knees. &ldquo;I
love to watch it all, but it makes the
shivers go over me&mdash;makes me feel sort
of lonesome. Don&#8217;t it you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp shook his head emphatically.
It was the one time in years that down in
the depths of his soul he had not felt
lonesome. For as Indian summer had
come back to earth, so youth had come
back to Mr. Opp. The flower of his being
was waking to bloom, and the spring
tides were at flood.</p>

<p>A belated robin overhead, unable
longer to contain his rapture, burst into
song; but Mr. Opp, equally full of his
subject, was unable to utter a syllable.
The sparkling eloquence and the fine
phrases had evaporated, and only the
bare truth was left.</p>

<p><a name="png.132" id="png.132"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">127</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Guinevere, having become aware of
the very ardent looks that were being
cast upon her, said she thought the boat
must be about due.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp; &ldquo;that is, I
was about to say&mdash;why&mdash;er&mdash;say, Miss
Guin-never, do you think you could ever
come to keer about me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guinevere, thus brought to bay, took
refuge in subterfuge. &ldquo;Why&mdash;Mr. Opp&mdash;I&#8217;m
not old enough for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are,&rdquo; he burst forth fervently.
&ldquo;You are everything for me:
old enough, and beautiful enough, and
smart enough, and sweet enough. I never
beheld a human creature that could even
begin to think about comparing with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guinevere, in the agitation of the moment,
nervously plucked all the leaves
from the branch that had been acquired
with such effort. It was with difficulty
that she finally managed to lift her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;ve been mighty good to me,&rdquo;
she faltered, &ldquo;and&mdash;and made me lots
happier; but I&mdash;I don&#8217;t care in the way
you mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.133" id="png.133"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">128</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Is there anybody else?&rdquo; demanded
Mr. Opp, ready to hurl himself to destruction
if she answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she answered him; &ldquo;there
never has been anybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="illus pgbrk"><a name="png.134" id="png.134"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span

 />&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, Mr. Opp, I&#8217;m not old enough&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&#8217;ll take my chance,&rdquo; said Mr.
Opp, expanding his narrow chest.
&ldquo;Whatever I&#8217;ve got out of the world
I&#8217;ve had to fight for. I don&#8217;t mind saying
to you that I was sorter started out
with a handicap. You know my sister&mdash;she&#8217;s
a&mdash;well, a&#8217; invalid, you might say,
and while her pa was living, my fortunes
wasn&#8217;t what you might call as favorable
as they are at present. I never thought
there would be any use in my considering
getting married till I met you, then
I didn&#8217;t seem able somehow to consider
nothing else. If you&#8217;ll just let me, I&#8217;ll
wait. I&#8217;ll learn you to care. I won&#8217;t
bother you, but just wait patient as long
as you say.&rdquo; And this from Mr. Opp,
whose sands of life were already half-run!
&ldquo;All I ask for,&rdquo; he went on wistfully,
&ldquo;is a little sign now and then.
<a name="png.136" id="png.136"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">131</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>You might give me a little look or something
just to keep the time from seeming
too long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was almost a question, and as he
leaned toward her, with the sunlight in
his eyes, something of the beauty of the
day touched him, too, just as it touched
the weed at his feet, making them both
for one transcendent moment part of the
glory of the world.</p>

<p>Guinevere Gusty, already in love with
love, and reaching blindly out for something
deeper and finer in her own life,
was suddenly engulfed in a wave of sympathy.
She involuntarily put out her
hand and touched his fingers.</p>

<p>The sun went down behind the distant
shore, and the light faded on the river.
Mr. Opp was almost afraid to breathe;
he sat with his eyes on the far horizon,
and that small, slender hand in his, and
for the moment the world was fixed in its
orbit, and Time itself stood still.</p>

<p>Suddenly out of the silence came the
long, low whistle of the boat. They
scrambled to their feet and hurried down
<a name="png.137" id="png.137"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">132</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the path, Mr. Opp having some trouble
in keeping up with the nimbler pace of
the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll be calculatin&#8217; every minute until
the arrival of the boat to-morrow night,&rdquo;
he was gasping as they came within sight
of the wharf. &ldquo;I&#8217;ll be envyin&#8217; every&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&#8217;s my band-box?&rdquo; demanded
Guinevere. &ldquo;Why, Mr. Opp, if you
haven&#8217;t gone and left it up in the
woods!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Five minutes later, just as the bell was
tapping for the boat to start, a flying figure
appeared on the wharf. He was hatless
and breathless, his coat was ripped
from collar to hem, and a large band-box
flapped madly against his legs as he ran.
He came down the home-stretch at a
record-breaking pace, stepped on board
as the gang-plank was lifted, deposited
his band-box on the deck, then with a
running jump cleared the rapidly widening
space between the boat and the shore,
and dropped upon the wharf.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">He continued waving his handkerchief
even after the boat had rounded the
<a name="png.138" id="png.138"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">133</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>curve, then, having edited a paper, promoted
a large enterprise, effected a proposal,
and performed two remarkable
athletic stunts all in the course of a day,
Mr. Opp turned his footsteps toward
home.</p>



<h2 class="chap"><a name="png.139" id="png.139"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span

 </span>IX</h2>


<p class="start"><img class="initial" src="images/t-initial.png"
 alt="T" title="T" width="149" height="150" /><span>he</span> next day dawned wet
and chilly. A fine mist
hung in the trees, and
the leaves and grasses
sagged under their burden
of moisture. All the
crimson and gold had changed to brown
and gray, and the birds and crickets had
evidently packed away their chirps and
retired for the season.</p>

<p>By the light of a flickering candle, Mr.
D.&nbsp;Webster Opp partook of a frugal
breakfast. The luxurious habits of the
Moore household had made breakfast a
movable feast depending upon the time
of Aunt Tish&#8217;s arrival, and in establishing
the new régime Mr. Opp had found it
necessary to prepare his own breakfast
in order to make sure of getting to the
office before noon.</p>

<p>As he sipped his warmed-over coffee,
<a name="png.140" id="png.140"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">135</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>with his elbows on the red table-cloth,
and his heels hooked on the rung of the
chair, he recited to himself in an undertone
from a very large and imposing
book which was propped in front of him,
the leaves held back on one side by a
candlestick and on the other by a salt-cellar.
It was a book which Mr. Opp was
buying on subscription, and it was called
&ldquo;An Encyclopedia of Wonder, Beauty,
and Wisdom.&rdquo; It contained pellets of
information on all subjects, and Mr. Opp
made it a practice to take several before
breakfast, and to repeat the dose at each
meal as circumstances permitted. &ldquo;An
editor,&rdquo; he told Nick, &ldquo;has got to keep
himself instructed on all subjects. He
has got to read wide and continuous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a rule he followed no special line in
his pursuit of knowledge, but with true
catholicity of taste, took the items as they
came, turning from a strenuous round
with &ldquo;Abbeys and Abbots,&rdquo; to enter
with fervor into the wilds of &ldquo;Abyssinia.&rdquo;
The straw which served as
bookmark pointed to-day to &ldquo;Ants,&rdquo; and
<a name="png.141" id="png.141"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">136</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>ordinarily Mr. Opp would have attacked
the subject with all the enthusiasm of an
entomologist. But even the best regulated
minds will at times play truant,
and Mr. Opp&#8217;s had taken a flying leap
and skipped six hundred and thirty-two
pages, landing recklessly in the middle
of &ldquo;Young Lochinvar.&rdquo; For the encyclopedia,
in its laudable endeavor not
only to cover all intellectual requirements,
but also to add the crowning
grace of culture, had appended a collection
of poems under the title &ldquo;Favorites,
Old and New.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp, thus a-wing on the winds of
poesy, had sipped his tepid coffee and
nibbled his burnt toast in fine abstraction
until he came upon a selection which
his soul recognized. He had found words
to the music that was ringing in his heart.
It was then that he propped the book
open before him, and determined not to
close it until he had made the lines his
own.</p>

<p>Later, as he trudged along the road to
town, he repeated the verses to himself,
<a name="png.142" id="png.142"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">137</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>patiently referring again and again to
the note-book in which he had copied the
first words of each line.</p>

<p>At the office door he regretfully dismounted
from Pegasus, and resolutely
turned his attention to the business of
the day. His desire was to complete the
week&#8217;s work by noon, spend the afternoon
at home in necessary preparation
for the coming guest, and have the following
day, which was Saturday, free to
devote to the interest of the oil company.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish this, expedition
was necessary, and Mr. Opp, being more
bountifully endowed by nature with energy
than with any other quality, fell to
work with a will. His zeal, however, interfered
with his progress, and he found
himself in the embarrassing condition of
a machine which is geared too high.</p>

<p>He was, moreover, a bit bruised and
stiff from the unusual performances of
the previous day, and any sudden motion
caused him to wince. But the pain
brought recollection, and recollection was
instant balm.</p>

<p><a name="png.143" id="png.143"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">138</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>It was hardly to be expected that
things would deviate from their usual
custom of becoming involved at a critical
time, so Mr. Opp was not surprised when
Nick was late and had to be spoken to, a
task which the editor always achieved
with great difficulty. Then the printing-press
had an acute attack of indigestion,
and no sooner was that relieved than the
appalling discovery was made that there
were no more good &ldquo;S&#8217;s&rdquo; in the type
drawer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Use dollar-marks for the next issue,&rdquo;
directed Mr. Opp, &ldquo;and I&#8217;ll wire
immediate to the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;re kinder short on &lsquo;I&#8217;s&rsquo; too,&rdquo;
said Nick. &ldquo;You take so many in your
articles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp looked injured. &ldquo;I very seldom
or never begin on an &lsquo;I,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said
indignantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You get &#8217;em in somehow,&rdquo; said Nick.
&ldquo;Why, the editor over at Coreyville
even said &lsquo;Our Wife.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, &ldquo;I will, too,&mdash;that
is&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.144" id="png.144"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">139</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The telephone-bell covered his retreat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he answered in a deep, incisive
voice to counteract the effect of his
recent embarrassment, &ldquo;Office of &lsquo;The
Opp Eagle.&rsquo; Mr. Toddlinger? Yes, sir.
You say you want your subscription
stopped! Well, now, wait a minute&mdash;see
here, I can explain that&mdash;&rdquo; but the other
party had evidently rung off.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp turned with exasperation
upon Nick:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what you went and did
last week?&rdquo; He rose and, going to the
file, consulted the top paper. &ldquo;There it
is,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;just identical with what he
asserted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick followed the accusing finger and
read:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Toddlinger moved this
week into their new horse and lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before explanations could be entered
into, there was a knock at the door.
When it was answered, a very small
black boy was discovered standing on the
step. He wore a red shirt and a pair of
ragged trousers, between which strained
<a name="png.145" id="png.145"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">140</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>relations existed, and on his head was
the brim of a hat from which the crown
had long since departed. Hanging on a
twine string about his neck was a large
onion.</p>

<p>He opened negotiations at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Miss says fer you-all to stop dat
frowin&#8217; papers an&#8217; sech like trash outen
de winder; dey blows over in our-all&#8217;s
yard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He delivered the message in the same
belligerent spirit with which it had evidently
been conveyed to him, and rolled
his eyes at Mr. Opp as if the offense had
been personal.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp drew him in, and closed the
door. &ldquo;Did&mdash;er&mdash;did Mrs. Gusty send
you over to say that?&rdquo; he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yas, sir; she done havin&#8217; a mad spell.
What&#8217;s dat dere machine fer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s a printing-press. Do you think
Mrs. Gusty is mad at me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Yas, sir</em>,&rdquo; emphatically; &ldquo;she&#8217;s mad
at ever&#8217;body. She &#8217;lows she gwine lick
me ef I don&#8217;t tek keer. She done got de
<a name="png.146" id="png.146"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">141</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>kitchen so full o&#8217; switches hit looks jes
lak outdoors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t think she would really whip
you,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, already feeling the
family responsibility.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw, sir; she jes &#8217;low she gwine to.
What&#8217;s in dem dere little drawers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Type,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp. &ldquo;You go back
and tell Mrs. Gusty that Mr. Opp says
he&#8217;s very sorry to have caused her any
inconvenience, and he&#8217;ll send over immediate
and pick up them papers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;s kinder skeered of her, too,
ain&#8217;t you?&rdquo; grinned the ambassador,
holding up one bare, black foot to the
stove. &ldquo;My mammy she sasses back, but
I runs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&#8217;d better run now,&rdquo; said
Mr. Opp, who resented such insight;
&ldquo;but, see here, what&#8217;s that onion for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To &#8217;sorb disease,&rdquo; said the youth,
with the air of one who is promulgating
some advanced theory in therapeutics;
&ldquo;hit ketches it &#8217;stid of you. My pappy
weared a&#8217; onion fer put-near a whole
year, an&#8217; hit &#8217;sorbed all de diseases whut
<a name="png.147" id="png.147"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">142</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>was hangin&#8217; round, an&#8217; nary a one never
teched him. An&#8217; one day my pappy he
got hongry, an&#8217; he et dat dere onion, an&#8217;
whut you reckon? He up an&#8217; died!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you go &#8217;long now,&rdquo; said Mr.
Opp, &ldquo;and tell Mrs. Gusty just exactly
verbatim what I told you. What did you
say was your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Val,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp managed to slip a nickel into
the dirty little hand without Nick&#8217;s seeing
him. Nick was rather firm about
these things, and disapproved heartily
of Mr. Opp&#8217;s indiscriminate charities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gimme nudder one an&#8217; I&#8217;ll tell you
de rest ob it,&rdquo; whispered Val on the
door-step.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp complied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Valentine Day Johnson,&rdquo; he announced
with pride; then pocketing his
prize, he vanished around the corner of
the house, forgetting his office of plenipotentiary
in his sudden accession of
wealth.</p>

<p>Once more peace settled on the office,
and Mr. Opp was engrossed in an article
<a name="png.148" id="png.148"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">143</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>on &ldquo;The Greatest Petroleum Proposition
South of the Mason and Dixon
Line,&rdquo; when an ominous, wheezing
cough announced the arrival of Mr.
Tucker. This was an unexpected catastrophe,
for Mr. Tucker&#8217;s day for spending
the morning at the office was Saturday,
when he came in to pay for his
paper. It seemed rather an unkind trick
of Fate&#8217;s that he should have been permitted
to arrive a day too soon.</p>

<p>The old gentleman drew up a chair to
the stove, then deliberately removed his
overcoat and gloves.</p>

<p>It was when he took off his overshoes,
however, that Mr. Opp and Nick exchanged
looks of despair. They had a
signal code which they habitually employed
when storms swept the office, but
in a calm like this they were powerless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mighty sorry to hear about that uprisin&#8217;
in Guatemala,&rdquo; said Mr. Tucker,
who took a vivid interest in foreign affairs,
but remained quite neutral about
questions at home.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp moved about the office
<a name="png.149" id="png.149"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">144</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>restlessly, knowing from experience that to
sit down in the presence of Mr. Tucker
was fatal. The only chance of escape lay
in motion. He sharpened his pencils,
straightened his desk, and tied up two
bundles of papers while Mr. Tucker&#8217;s address
on the probable future of the Central
American republics continued. Then
Mr. Opp was driven to extreme measures.
He sent himself a telegram. This
ruse was occasionally resorted to, to free
the office from unwelcome visitors without
offending them, and served incidentally
to produce an effect which was not
unpleasant to the editor.</p>

<p>Scribbling a message on a telegraph-blank
procured for the purpose from Mr.
Gallop, Mr. Opp handed it secretly to
Nick, who in turn vanished out of the
back door only to reappear at the front.
Then the editor, with much ostentation,
opened the envelop, and, after reading
the contents, declared that he had business
that would require immediate action.
Would Mr. Tucker excuse him? If
so, Nick would hold his coat.</p>

<p><a name="png.150" id="png.150"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">145</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; protested Mr. Tucker, resisting
the effort to force him into his overcoat,
&ldquo;I want to talk over this oil
business. We don&#8217;t want to take any
risks with those fellows. As I was a-saying
to Mr. Hager&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, taking his own
hat from a nail, and apparently in great
haste, &ldquo;I know, of course. You are exactly
right about it. We&#8217;ll just talk it
over as we go up-street,&rdquo; and linking his
arm through Mr. Tucker&#8217;s, he steered
him up the muddy channel of Main
Street, and safely into the harbor of Our
Hotel, where he anchored him breathless,
but satisfied.</p>

<p>Having thus disposed, to the best of
his ability, of his business for the week,
Mr. Opp turned his attention to his yet
more arduous domestic affairs. The
menu for the guest&#8217;s dinner had weighed
rather heavily upon him all day, for he
had never before entertained in his own
home. His heart had been set on turkey;
but as that was out of the question,
he compromised on a goose,
<a name="png.151" id="png.151"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">146</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>adhering tenaciously to the cranberry
sauce.</p>

<p>It was easier to decide on the goose
than it was to procure it, and some time
was consumed in the search. Mr. Opp
brought all his mental powers to bear on
the subject, and attacked the problem
with a zeal that merited success.</p>

<p>When he reached home at noon with
his arm full of bundles, Aunt Tish met
him with lamentations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dey ain&#8217;t but one clean table-cloth,
an&#8217; hit&#8217;s got a hole in hit, an&#8217; I can&#8217;t find
no sheets to put on de company baid, an&#8217;
dere ain&#8217;t three cups an&#8217; saucers in de
house what belongs to theyselves. I
shorely doan know what you thinkin&#8217;
&#8217;bout, Mr. D., to go an&#8217; ast company fer.
We-all never does hab company. An&#8217;
Miss Kippy she be&#8217;n habin&#8217; a sort er
spell, too, cryin&#8217; to herself, an&#8217; won&#8217;t tell
me whut&#8217;s de matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp shook the raindrops from his
hat-brim, and laid the goose tenderly on
the table; then he stepped inside the dining-room
door, and stood watching the
<a name="png.152" id="png.152"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">147</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>childish figure that sat on the floor before
the fire. She was putting artificial flowers
on her head, and every time they fell
off, she dropped her head on her knees
and sobbed softly to herself. Again and
again she made the experiment, and again
and again the faded roses came tumbling
into her lap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll fix &#8217;em,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, coming
up behind her; &ldquo;don&#8217;t you cry about it,
Kippy; I can make them stay, easy.&rdquo; He
searched around in the clothes-press until
he found a paper box, which he tied
securely upon Miss Kippy&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now try it,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;put the flowers
on your head; they&#8217;ll stay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Timidly, as if afraid of another disappointment,
she tried, and when the flowers
were caught in the box, she gave a
sigh of satisfaction and delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sence I j&#8217;ined de church!&rdquo; exclaimed
Aunt Tish, who had been watching
proceedings from the doorway; then
she added, as Mr. Opp came into the
hall: &ldquo;Hit beats my time de way you
handles dat pore chile. Sometimes she
<a name="png.153" id="png.153"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">148</span><span class="ns">]

She ast me t&#8217;other day if she wasn&#8217;t
crazy. I &#8217;lowed no indeedy, dat crazy
folks was lock up in a lunatic asylum.
An&#8217; she says &lsquo;Where?&rsquo; &lsquo;Up at Coreyville,&rsquo;
I say. She went on playin&#8217; jes as
nice and happy. De chile&#8217;s all right ef
she don&#8217;t git a fool notion; den dey ain&#8217;t
nobody kin make out what she wants inceptin&#8217;
you. She been cryin&#8217; over dem
flowers ever sence breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&#8217;t you come after me?&rdquo;
demanded Mr. Opp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jes to tie a box on her haid?&rdquo; asked
Aunt Tish. &ldquo;Lor&#8217;, I thought you was
busy makin&#8217; dem newspapers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I am,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, &ldquo;but whenever
Miss Kippy gets to crying, I want
you to come direct after me, do you hear?
There ain&#8217;t anything more important
than in keeping her from getting worried.
Now, let&#8217;s have a look at that
there table-cloth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All afternoon Mr. Opp encountered
difficulties that would have disheartened
a less courageous host. With the limited
<a name="png.154" id="png.154"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">149</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>means at hand it seemed impossible to
entertain in a manner befitting the dignity
of the editor of &ldquo;The Opp Eagle.&rdquo;
But Mr. Opp, though sorely perplexed,
was not depressed, for beneath the disturbed
surface of his thoughts there ran
an undercurrent of pure joy. It caused
him to make strange, unnatural sounds
in his throat which he meant for song; it
made him stop every now and then in his
work to glance tenderly and reminiscently
at the palm of his right hand, once
even going so far as to touch it softly
with his lips. For since the last sun had
set there had been no waking moment but
had held for him the image of a golden
world inhabited solely by a pair of luminous
eyes, one small hand, and, it must
be added, a band-box.</p>

<p>Through the busy afternoon Mr. Opp
referred constantly to his watch, and in
spite of the manifold duties to be performed,
longed impatiently for evening
to arrive. At five o&#8217;clock he had moved
the furniture from one bedroom to another,
demonstrated beyond a possibility
<a name="png.155" id="png.155"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">150</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of doubt that a fire could not be made in
the parlor grate without the chimney
smoking, mended two chairs, hung a pair
of curtains, and made three errands to
town. So much accomplished, he turned
his attention to the most difficult task
of all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kippy,&rdquo; he said, going to the window
where she was gleefully tracing the
course of the raindrops as they chased
down the pane. &ldquo;Stop a minute, Kippy.
Listen; I want to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Kippy turned obediently, but her
lips continued the dumb conversation she
was having with the rain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How would you like,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp,
approaching the subject cautiously, &ldquo;to
play like you was a grown-up lady&mdash;just
for to-night, you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Kippy looked at him suspiciously,
and her lips stopped moving. Heretofore
she had resisted all efforts to change
her manner of dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&#8217;s a gentleman a-coming,&rdquo;
continued Mr. Opp, persuasively; &ldquo;he&#8217;s
going to remain over till to-morrow, and
<a name="png.156" id="png.156"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">151</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Aunt Tish is cooking that large goose for
him, and I&#8217;ve been fixing up the spare
room. We are all endeavoring to give
him a nice time. Don&#8217;t you want to dress
up for him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will it make him glad?&rdquo; asked Miss
Kippy.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp expiated on the enjoyment
it would give the unknown guest to see
Kippy in the blue merino dress which
Aunt Tish had gotten out of Mrs. Opp&#8217;s
old trunk up-stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&#8217;ll let Aunt Tish arrange
your hair up like a lady?&rdquo; went on Mr.
Opp, pushing the point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Kippy, after a moment,
&ldquo;Oxety will. She will make him
glad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Mr. Opp. &ldquo;And if you
will sit nice and quiet and never say a
word all through supper, I&#8217;ll get you a
book with pictures in it, representing
flowers and things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roses?&rdquo; asked Miss Kippy, drawing
a quick breath of delight; and when Mr.
Opp nodded, she closed her eyes and
<a name="png.157" id="png.157"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">152</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>smiled as if heaven were within sight.
For Miss Kippy was like a harp across
which some rough hand had swept, snapping
all the strings but two, the high one
of ecstasy and the low one of despair.</p>

<p>At six o&#8217;clock Mr. Opp went up to
make his toilet. The rain, which had
been merely rehearsing all day, was now
giving a regular performance, and it
played upon the windows, and went trilling
through the gutters on the roof, while
the old cedar-tree scraped an accompaniment
on the corner of the porch below.
But, nothing daunted, Mr. Opp donned
his bravest attire. Cyclones and tornadoes
could not have deterred him from
making the most elaborate toilet at his
command. To be sure, he turned up the
hem of his trousers and tied a piece of
oilcloth securely about each leg, and he
also spread a handkerchief tenderly over
his pink necktie; but these could be easily
removed after he heard the boat whistle.</p>

<p>He dressed by the light of a sputtering
candle before a small mirror the veracity
of which was more than questionable. It
<a name="png.158" id="png.158"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">153</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>presented him to himself as a person
with a broad, flat face, the nose of which
appeared directly between his eyes, and
the mouth on a line with the top of his
ears. But he made allowances for these
idiosyncrasies on the part of the mirror;
in fact, he made such liberal allowances
that he was quite satisfied with the reflection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll procure the hack to bring the
company back in,&rdquo; he said to Aunt Tish
rather nervously as he passed through
the kitchen. &ldquo;You assist Miss Kippy to
get arranged, and I&#8217;ll carry up the coal
and set the table after I return back
home. I can do it while the company is
up in his room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the way into town, as he splashed
along the muddy road, he was alternately
dreading the arrival of one passenger,
and anticipating joyfully, the
arrival of another. For as the time approached
the impending presence of the
company began to take ominous form,
and Mr. Opp grew apprehensive.</p>

<p>At the landing he found everything
<a name="png.159" id="png.159"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">154</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>dark and quiet. Evidently the packet
was unusually late, and the committee appointed
to meet it and conduct the guests
to their various destinations was waiting
somewhere uptown, probably at Your
Hotel. Mr. Opp paused irresolute: his
soul yearned for solitude, but the rain-soaked
dock offered no shelter except the
slight protection afforded by a pile of
empty boxes. Selecting the driest and
largest of these, he turned it on end, and
by an adroit adjustment of his legs, succeeded
in getting inside.</p>

<p>Below, the river rolled heavily past in
the twilight, sending up tiny juts of water
to meet the pelting rain. A cold, penetrating
mist clung to the ground, and
the wind carried complaining tales from
earth to heaven. Everything breathed
discomfort, but Mr. Opp knew it not.</p>

<p>His soul was sailing sunlit seas of
bliss, fully embarked at last upon the
most magic and immortal of all illusions.
Sitting cramped and numb in his narrow
quarters, he peered eagerly into the
darkness, watching for the first lights of
<a name="png.160" id="png.160"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">155</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the <i>Sunny South</i> to twinkle through the
gloom. And as he watched he chanted
in a sing-song ecstasy:</p>

<div class="quote pgbrk">
<div class="poem">
<div>&ldquo;She is coming, my own, my sweet;</div>
<div class="i2">Were it ever so airy a tread,</div>
<div>My heart would hear her and beat,</div>
<div class="i2">Were it earth in an earthy bed;</div>
<div>My dust would hear her and beat,</div>
<div class="i2">Had I lain for a century dead;</div>
<div>Would start and tremble under her feet,</div>
<div class="i2">And blossom in purple and red.&rdquo;</div>
</div>

<p class="start"><img class="initial" src="images/w-initial.png"
 alt="W" title="W" width="144" height="150" /><span>hen</span> Miss Guinevere
Gusty tripped up the
gang-plank of the <i>Sunny
South</i> late that afternoon,
vainly trying to
protect herself from the
driving rain, she was met half-way by
the gallant old captain.</p>

<p>Tradition had it that the captain had
once cast a favorable eye upon her
mother; but Mrs. Gusty, being cross-eyed,
had looked elsewhere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are a pudding without plums,&rdquo;
he announced gaily, as he held the umbrella
at an angle calculated to cause a
waterspout in the crown of her hat&mdash;&ldquo;not
a lady on board. All we needed
was a beautiful young person like you to
liven us up. You haven&#8217;t forgotten
those pretty tunes you played for me last
trip, have you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.162" id="png.162"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">157</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Guinevere laughed, and shook her
head. &ldquo;That was just for you and the
girls,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&#8217;ll be for me and the boys
this time. I&#8217;ve got a nice lot of gentlemen
on board, going down to your place,
by the way, to buy up all your oil-lands.
Now I know you are going to play for
us if I ask you to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My goodness! are they on this
boat?&rdquo; asked Guinevere, in a flutter. &ldquo;I
am so glad; I just love to watch city
people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the captain; &ldquo;that was
Mr. Mathews talking to me as you came
aboard&mdash;the one with the white beard.
Everything that man touches turns to
money. That glum-looking young fellow
over there is his secretary. Hinton
is his name; curious sort of chap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guinevere followed his glance with
eager interest. &ldquo;The solemn one with
the cap pulled over his eyes?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>The captain nodded. &ldquo;All the rest are
inside playing cards and having a good
time; but he&#8217;s been moping around like
<a name="png.163" id="png.163"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">158</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>that ever since they got on board. I&#8217;ve
got to go below now, but when I come
back, you&#8217;ll play some for me, won&#8217;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guinevere protested violently, but
something within her whispered that if
the captain was very insistent she would
render the selection which had won her a
gold medal at the last commencement.</p>

<p>Slipping into the saloon, she dropped
quietly into one of the very corpulent
chairs which steamboats particularly affect,
and, unobserved, proceeded to give
herself up to the full enjoyment of the
occasion. The journey from Coreyville
to the Cove, in the presence of the distinguished
strangers, had assumed the
nature of an adventure. Giving her
imagination free rein, Miss Gusty, without
apology, transported the commonplace
group of business men at the card-table
into the wildest realms of romance.
The fact that their language, appearance,
and manner spoke of the city, was
for her a sufficient peg upon which to
hang innumerable conjectures. So deep
<a name="png.164" id="png.164"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">159</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>was she in her speculations that she did
not hear the captain come up behind her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where have you been hiding?&rdquo; he
asked in stentorian tones. &ldquo;I was afraid
you&#8217;d gotten out on deck and the wind
had blown you overboard. Don&#8217;t you
think it&#8217;s about time for that little tune?
We are forty minutes late now, and
we&#8217;ll lose another half-hour taking on
freight at Smither&#8217;s Landing. I&#8217;ve
been banking on hearing that little
dance-piece you played for me before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&#8217;t play&mdash;before them,&rdquo; said
Guinevere, nervously.</p>

<p>The captain laughed. &ldquo;Yes, you can;
they&#8217;ll like it. Mr. Mathews said something
mighty pretty about you when you
came on board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&#8217;t&mdash;honest?&rdquo; said Guinevere,
blushing. &ldquo;Oh, truly, Captain, I
can&#8217;t play!&rdquo; But even as she spoke she
unbuttoned her gloves. Her accomplishment
was clamoring for an exhibition,
and though her spirit failed her,
she twirled the piano-stool and took her
seat.</p>

<p><a name="png.165" id="png.165"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">160</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The group of men at the table, heretofore
indifferent to proceedings, looked
up when a thundering chord broke the
stillness. A demure young girl, with
gentle, brown eyes, was making a furious
and apparently unwarranted attack
upon the piano. Her one desire evidently
was to get inside of the instrument.
With insinuating persistence she
essayed an entrance through the treble,
and, being unable to effect it, fell upon
the bass, and exhausted a couple of
rounds of ammunition there. The assault
on both flanks being unsuccessful,
she resorted to strategy, crossing her
hands and assailing each wing of the
enemy from an unexpected quarter.
When this move failed, she evidently
became incensed, and throwing aside
diplomacy, rallied all her forces, charging
her artillery up to the highest note,
then thundering down to the lowest,
beating down the keys as fast as they
dared to rise. In the midst of the
carnage, when the clamor was at its
height and victory seemed imminent, she
<a name="png.166" id="png.166"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">161</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>suddenly paused, with one hand in air
and her head gently inclined, and, tapping
out two silvery bugle-notes of truce,
raised the siege.</p>

<p>The appalling silence that ensued
might have hung above a battle-field of
slain and wounded. The captain bit his
mustache.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That wasn&#8217;t exactly the one I
meant,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want that little
dance-tune with the jingle to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Gusty, disappointed and surprised
at the effect which her masterpiece
had failed to produce, was insisting
with flushed cheeks that she could
play no more, when the gentleman who
was called Mr. Mathews rose from the
table and came toward her. His hair
and pointed beard were white, but his
eyes were still young, and he looked at
her while he spoke to the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Captain,&rdquo; he was
saying in smooth, even tones, &ldquo;can&#8217;t you
persuade the young lady to sing something
for us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never took vocal,&rdquo; said Guinevere,
<a name="png.167" id="png.167"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">162</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>looking at him frankly. &ldquo;I&#8217;m making a
specialty of instrumental.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gentleman looked sidewise at his
companions and stroked his beard
gravely. &ldquo;But you <em>do</em> sing?&rdquo; he persisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just popular music,&rdquo; said Guinevere.
&ldquo;I was going to take &lsquo;The Holy
City&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Rosary&rsquo; last year, but the
vocal teacher got sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In response to a very urgent invitation,
she took her seat again, and this
time sang a sentimental ditty concerning
the affairs of one &ldquo;Merry Little
Milly in the Month of May.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This selection met with prompt favor,
and the men left their cards, and gathered
about the piano, demanding an encore.</p>

<p>Miss Guinevere&#8217;s voice was very
small, and her accompaniment very
loud, but, in her effort to please, she unconsciously
became dramatic in her expression,
and frowned and smiled and
lifted her brows in sympathy with the
emotions of the damsel in the song.
And Miss Guinevere&#8217;s eyes being
<a name="png.168" id="png.168"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">163</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>expressive and her lips very red, the result
proved most satisfactory to the
audience.</p>

<p>One stout young man in particular expressed
himself in such unrestrained
terms of enthusiasm, that Guinevere,
after singing several songs, became visibly
embarrassed. Upon the plea of
being too warm she made her escape,
half-promising to return and sing again
later on.</p>

<p>Flushed with the compliments and the
excitement, and a little uncertain about
the propriety of it all, she hurried
through the swing-door and, turning
suddenly on the deck, stumbled over
something in the darkness.</p>

<p>It proved to be a pair of long legs that
were stretched out in front of a silent
figure, who shot a hand out to restore
Miss Gusty to an upright position. But
the deck was slippery from the rain, and
before he could catch her, she went down
on her knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did it hurt you?&rdquo; a voice asked anxiously.</p>

<p><a name="png.169" id="png.169"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">164</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;It don&#8217;t matter about me,&rdquo; answered
Guinevere, &ldquo;just so it didn&#8217;t spoil my
new dress. I&#8217;m afraid there&#8217;s an awful
tear in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; said the voice. &ldquo;I&#8217;d
hate to be guilty of dress slaughter even
in the second degree. Sure you are
not hurt? Sit down a minute; here&#8217;s
a chair right behind you, out of the
wind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guinevere groped about for the chair.
&ldquo;Mother can mend it,&rdquo; she went on,
voicing her anxiety, &ldquo;if it isn&#8217;t too
bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if it is?&rdquo; asked the voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll have to wear it, anyhow. It&#8217;s
brand splinter new, the first one I ever
had made by a sure-enough dressmaker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My abominable legs!&rdquo; muttered the
voice.</p>

<p>Guinevere laughed, and all at once became
curious concerning the person who
belonged to the legs.</p>

<p>He had dropped back into his former
position, with feet outstretched, hands in
<a name="png.170" id="png.170"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">165</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>pockets, and cap pulled over his eyes,
and he did not seem inclined to continue
the conversation.</p>

<p>She drew in deep breaths of the cool
air, and watched the big side-wheel
churn the black water into foam, and
throw off sprays of white into the darkness.
She liked to be out there in the
sheltered corner, watching the rain dash
past, and to hear the wind whistling up
the river. She was glad to be in the
dark, too, away from all those gentlemen,
so ready with their compliments.
But the sudden change from the heated
saloon to the cold deck chilled her, and
she sneezed.</p>

<p>Her companion stirred. &ldquo;If you are
going to stay out here, you ought to put
something around you,&rdquo; he said irritably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m not very cold. Besides, I don&#8217;t
want to go in. I don&#8217;t want them to
make me sing any more. Mother&#8217;ll be
awfully provoked if I take cold, though.
Do you think it&#8217;s too damp?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&#8217;s my overcoat,&rdquo; said the
<a name="png.171" id="png.171"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">166</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>man, indifferently; &ldquo;you can put that
around you if you want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She struggled into the large sleeves,
and he made no effort to help her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&#8217;t like music, do you?&rdquo; she
asked naïvely as she settled back in her
chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I
should say the thing I dislike least in the
world is music.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why didn&#8217;t you come in to
hear me play?&rdquo; asked Guinevere, emboldened
by the darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I could hear it outside,&rdquo; he assured
her; &ldquo;besides, I have a pair of
defective lamps in my head. The electric
lights hurt my eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He struck a match as he spoke to relight
his pipe, and by its flare she caught
her first glimpse of his face, a long,
slender, sensitive face, brooding and unhappy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you are Mr. Hinton,&rdquo; she
said as if to herself.</p>

<p>He turned with the lighted match in
his hand. &ldquo;How did you know that?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.172" id="png.172"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">167</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;The captain told me. He pointed out
you and Mr. Mathews, but he didn&#8217;t tell
me any of the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A branch of your education that can
afford to remain neglected,&rdquo; said Mr.
Hinton as he puffed at his pipe.</p>

<p>The door of the saloon swung open,
and the chubby gentleman appeared in
the light, shading his eyes, and calling
out that they were all waiting for the
little canary-bird.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t want to go,&rdquo; whispered
Guinevere, shrinking back into the
shadow.</p>

<p>The chubby gentleman peered up and
down the deck, then, assailed by a gust
of wind, beat a hasty retreat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t like him,&rdquo; announced Guinevere,
drawing a breath of relief. &ldquo;It
isn&#8217;t just because he&#8217;s fat and ugly;
it&#8217;s the silly way he looks at you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a pity you can&#8217;t tell him so!&rdquo;
said her companion, dryly. &ldquo;Such blasphemy
might do him good. He is the
scion of a distinguished family made
wealthy by the glorious sale of pork.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.173" id="png.173"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">168</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Are all the gentlemen millionaires?&rdquo;
asked Guinevere in awe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Present company excepted,&rdquo; qualified
Hinton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;ll seem awful small to them down
in the Cove. Why, we haven&#8217;t got room
enough at the two hotels to put them all
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you live there, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I&#8217;ve just been up at Coreyville
spending the night. I used to hate it
down at the Cove, it was so little and
stupid; but I like it better now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a long silence, during which
each pursued a widely different line of
thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have got a newspaper at the
Cove now,&rdquo; announced Guinevere. &ldquo;It&#8217;s
an awful nice paper, called &lsquo;The Opp
Eagle.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Opp?&rdquo; repeated Hinton. &ldquo;Oh, yes,
that was the man I telephoned to. What
sort of chap is he, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&#8217;s awfully smart,&rdquo; said Guinevere,
her cheeks tingling. &ldquo;Not so much
<a name="png.174" id="png.174"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">169</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>book learning, but a fine brain. The
preacher says he&#8217;s got a natural gift of
language. You ought to see some of his
editorials.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hiding his light under a bushel,
isn&#8217;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s just it,&rdquo; said Guinevere, glad
to expatiate on the subject. &ldquo;If Mr. Opp
could get in a bigger place and get more
chances, he&#8217;d have a lot more show.
But he won&#8217;t leave Miss Kippy. She&#8217;s
his sister, you know; there is only the
two of them, and she&#8217;s kind of crazy,
and has to have somebody take care of
her. Mother thinks it&#8217;s just awful he
don&#8217;t send her to an asylum, but I know
how he feels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he a young man?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Hinton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;no, not exactly; he&#8217;s just seventeen
years and two months older than
I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Hinton, comprehensively.</p>

<p>There was another long pause, during
which Guinevere turned things over in
<a name="png.175" id="png.175"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">170</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>her mind, and Mr. Hinton knocked the
ashes from his pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think girls seem a good deal older
than they are, don&#8217;t you?&rdquo; she asked
presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some girls,&rdquo; Hinton agreed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How old would you take me for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the dark?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About twelve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&#8217;s not fair,&rdquo; said Guinevere.
&ldquo;I&#8217;m eighteen, and lots of people
take me for twenty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is when they can see you,&rdquo; said
Hinton.</p>

<p>Guinevere decided that she did not
like him. She leaned back in her corner
and tried not to talk. But this course
had its disadvantage, for when she was
silent he seemed to forget she was there.</p>

<p>Once he took a turn up and down the
deck, and when he came back, he stood
for a long time leaning over the rail and
gazing into the water. As he turned to
sit down she heard him mutter to himself:</p>

<div class="quote">
<div class="poem">
<div><a name="png.176" id="png.176"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">171</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;&hellip;&nbsp;That no life lives forever;</div>
<div>That dead men rise up never;</div>
<div>That even the weariest river</div>
<div>Winds somewhere safe to sea.&rdquo;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Guinevere repeated the words softly
to herself, and wondered what they
meant. She was still thinking about
them when a dim red light in the distance
told her they were approaching the
Cove. She slipped off the heavy overcoat
and began to put on her gloves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello! we are getting in, are we?&rdquo;
asked Hinton, shaking himself into an
upright position. &ldquo;Is that Cove City
where the big red light bores into the
water like a corkscrew?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They moved to the bow of the boat and
watched as it changed its course and
made for the opposite shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you mean,&rdquo; said Guinevere, absently,
&ldquo;that you wanted it all to end
like that? For us to just go out into
nothing, like the river gets lost in the
ocean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hinton glanced at her in surprise, and
<a name="png.177" id="png.177"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">172</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>discovered that there was an unusually
thoughtful face under the sweeping brim
of the red hat. The fact that she was
pretty was less evident to him than the
fact that she was wistful. His mood
was sensitive to minor chords.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you <em>are</em> eighteen,&rdquo; he said,
and he smiled, and Guinevere smiled
back, and the chubby gentleman, coming
suddenly out upon them, went in again
and slammed the door.</p>

<p>The lights on the landing twinkled
brighter and brighter, and presently figures
could be seen moving here and
there. The steamer, grumbling with
every chug of the wheel, was brought
around, and the roustabouts crowded
along the rail, ready to make her fast.</p>

<p>Guinevere and Hinton stood on the
upper deck under his umbrella and
waited.</p>

<p>Directly below them on the dock a
small, fantastic figure made frantic efforts
to attract their attention. He
stood uncovered, regardless of the rain,
madly waving his hat.</p>

<p><a name="png.178" id="png.178"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">173</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Is that anybody you know?&rdquo; asked
Hinton.</p>

<p>Guinevere, who was watching the
lights on the water, started guiltily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down to the right&mdash;that comical little
codger in the checked suit.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">Guinevere looked, then turned upon
Hinton eyes that were big with indignation.
&ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;that&#8217;s Mr. Opp.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="start"><img class="initial" src="images/a-initial.png"
 alt="A" title="A" width="156" height="150" /><span>s</span> Willard Hinton stood
on the porch of Your
Hotel and waited for his
host for the night to call
for him, he was in that
state of black dejection
that comes to a young man when Ambition
has proposed to Fortune, and been
emphatically rejected. For six years he
had worked persistently and ceaselessly
toward a given goal, doing clerical work
by day and creative work by night,
going from shorthand into longhand, and
from numerical figures into figures of
speech. For the way that Hinton&#8217;s soul
was traveling was the Inky Way, and at
its end lay Authorship.</p>

<p>Hinton had taken himself and his
work seriously, and served an apprenticeship
of hard study and conscientious
<a name="png.180" id="png.180"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">175</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>preparation. So zealous was he, in fact,
that he had arrived at the second stage
of his great enterprise with a teeming
brain, a practised hand, and a pair of
affected eyes over which the oculists
shook their heads and offered little encouragement.</p>

<p>For four months he had implicitly
obeyed orders, attending only to his
regular work, eating and sleeping with
exemplary regularity, and spending all
of his spare time in the open air. But
the ravages made in the long nights
dedicated to the Muses were not to be so
easily repaired, and his eyes, instead of
improving, were growing rapidly worse.
The question of holding his position had
slipped from a matter of months into
weeks.</p>

<p>As he stood on the porch, he could
hear the bustle of entertainment going
on within the limited quarters of Your
Hotel. Jimmy Fallows was in his element.
As bartender, head waiter, and
jovial landlord he was playing a triple
bill to a crowded house. Occasionally he
<a name="png.181" id="png.181"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">176</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>opened the door and urged Hinton to
come inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Opp&#8217;ll be here &#8217;fore long,&rdquo; he
would say. &ldquo;He&#8217;s expecting you, but
he had to stop by to take his girl home.
You better step in and get a julep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Hinton, wrapped in the gloom of
his own thoughts, preferred to remain
where he was. Already he seemed to
belong to the dark, to be a thing apart
from his fellow-men. He shrank from
companionship and sympathy as he
shrank from the light. He longed to
crawl away like a sick animal into some
lonely corner and die. Whichever way
he turned, the great specter of darkness
loomed before him. At first he had
fought, then he had philosophically stood
still, now he was retreating. Again and
again he told himself that he would meet
it like a man, and again and again he
shrank back, ready to seek escape anywhere,
<ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 original ends paragraph with a double closing quote">anyhow.</ins></p>

<p>&ldquo;O God, if I weren&#8217;t so damnably
young!&rdquo; he cried to himself, beating his
clenched hand against his brow. &ldquo;More
<a name="png.182" id="png.182"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">177</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>than half my life yet to live, and in the
dark!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rattle of wheels and the stopping
of a light in front of the hotel made him
pull himself together.</p>

<p>The small gentleman in the checked
suit whom he had seen on the wharf
strode in without seeing him. He paused
before he opened the door and smoothed
his scanty locks and rearranged his
pink necktie. Then he drew in his
chin, threw out his chest, and with a
carefully prepared smile of welcome
entered.</p>

<p>The buzz within increased, and it was
some minutes before the door opened
again and Jimmy Fallows was heard
saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&#8217;s round here some place. Mr.
Hinton! Oh, here you are! Let me
make you acquainted with Mr. Opp;
he&#8217;s going to take you out to his house
for the night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No sooner had Hinton&#8217;s hand been released
from Mr. Opp&#8217;s cordial grasp
than he felt that gentleman&#8217;s arm thrust
<a name="png.183" id="png.183"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">178</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>through his, and was aware of being rapidly
conducted down the steps and out to
the vehicle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On no possible account,&rdquo; Mr. Opp
was saying, with Hinton&#8217;s grip in one
hand and two umbrellas in the other,
&ldquo;would I have allowed myself to be late,
except that it was what you might consider
absolutely necessary. Now, you
get right in; just take all that robe. No,
the grip can go right here between my
feet. We trust that you will not regard
the weather in any ways synonymous
with the state of our feelings of welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Hinton remarked rather shortly
that the weather never mattered to him
one way or another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s precisely like myself,&rdquo; Mr.
Opp went on. &ldquo;I come of very sturdy,
enduring stock. For a man of my size I
doubt if you&#8217;d find a finer constitution
in the country. You wouldn&#8217;t particularly
think it to look at me, now would
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hinton looked at the small, stooping
<a name="png.184" id="png.184"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">179</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>figure, and at the peaked, sallow face,
and said rather sarcastically that he
would not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strong as an ox,&rdquo; declared Mr. Opp.</p>

<p>Just here the horse stumbled, and they
were jerked violently forward.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp apologized. &ldquo;Just at present
we are having a little difficulty with
our country roads. We have taken the
matter up in &lsquo;The Opp Eagle&rsquo; last week.
All these things take time to regulate,
but we are getting there. This oil boom
is going to revolutionize things. It&#8217;s
my firm and abiding conviction that we
are on the eve of a great change. It
wouldn&#8217;t surprise me in the least if this
town grew to be one of the principalest
cities on the Ohio River.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be a worthy eyrie for your
&lsquo;Eagle&rsquo;?&rdquo; suggested Hinton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Opp Eagle,&rsquo;&rdquo; corrected Mr.
Opp. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t know as you know that I
am the sole proprietor, as well as being
the editor in addition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hinton, &ldquo;I did not know.
How does it happen that a man with such
<a name="png.185" id="png.185"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">180</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>responsibilities can take time to dabble
in oil-wells?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&#8217;t know me,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp,
with a paternal smile at his own ability.
&ldquo;Promoting and organizing comes as
natural to me as breathing the atmosphere.
I am engineering this scheme
with one hand, the Town Improvement
League with another, and &lsquo;The Opp
Eagle&rsquo; with another. Then, in a minor
kind of way, I am a active Odd Fellow,
first cornetist in the Unique Orchestra,
and a director in the bank. And beside,&rdquo;
Mr. Opp concluded with some coyness,
&ldquo;there is the natural personal social diversions
that most young men indulge
in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the
gray old house on the river-bank, and
Mr. Opp hitched the horse and held the
lantern, while Hinton stepped from one
stony island to another in the sea of
mud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just enter right into the dining-room,&rdquo;
said Mr. Opp, throwing open the
door. &ldquo;Unfortunately we are having a
<a name="png.186" id="png.186"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">181</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>temporary difficulty with the parlor
heating apparatus. If you&#8217;ll just pass
right on up-stairs, I&#8217;ll show you the
guest-chamber. Be careful of your
head, please!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With pomp and dignity Mr. Hinton
was conducted to his apartment, and
urged to make known any possible want
that might occur to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll be obliged to leave you for a
spell,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, &ldquo;in order to attend
to the proper putting up of the
horse. If you&#8217;ll just consider everything
you see as yours, and make yourself
entirely at home, I&#8217;ll come up for
you in about twenty minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Left alone, Hinton went to the bureau
to pin a paper around the lamp, and as
he did so he encountered a smiling face
in the mirror. The face was undoubtedly
his, but the smile seemed almost to
belong to a stranger, so long had it been
since he had seen it.</p>

<p>He made a hasty toilet, and sat down
with his back to the light to await his
summons to dinner. The large room,
<a name="png.187" id="png.187"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">182</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>poorly and scantily furnished, gave unmistakable
evidence of having been arranged
especially for his coming. There
was no covering on the floor, there were
no pictures on the wall; but the wall-paper
was of a sufficiently decorative
character to warrant the absence of
other adornment. It may be said to
have been a botanical paper, for roses
and lilies and sunflowers and daisies
grew in riotous profusion. The man
who hung the paper evidently was of a
scientific turn, for in matching the strips
he had gained some results in cross-grafting
that approached the miraculous.</p>

<p>After sufficient time had elapsed to
have stabled half a dozen horses, Hinton,
whose appetite was becoming ravenous,
went into the hall and started down
the steps. When half-way down he
heard a crash of china, and saw his host,
in his shirt-sleeves, staggering under a
large tray overcrowded with dishes.</p>

<p>Beating a hasty retreat, he went
quietly up the steps again, but not before
he heard a querulous voice remonstrate:</p>

<p><a name="png.188" id="png.188"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">183</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Now, Mr. D., if you ain&#8217;t done busted
two plates and a tea-cup!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Retiring to his room until the trouble
should be adjusted, Hinton once more
contemplated the floral paper. As he sat
there, the door creaked slightly, and
looking up, he thought he saw some one
peeping at him through the crack. Later
he distinctly heard the rustle of garments,
a stealthy step, and the closing of
the door across the hall.</p>

<p>At last Mr. Opp came somewhat noisily
up the steps and, flinging wide the
door, invited him to descend. In the
dining-room below the scene was nothing
short of festal. All the candlesticks
were filled with lighted candles, an
American flag was draped across the top
of the clock, and the little schooner that
rocked behind the pendulum seemed fired
with the determination to get somewhere
to-night if it never did again. Even
the owls on each end of the mantel
wore a benignant look, and seemed
to beam a welcome on the honored
guest.</p>

<p><a name="png.189" id="png.189"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">184</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>But it was the dining-table that held
the center of the stage, and that held
everything else as well. The dinner,
through its sequence of soup, meat,
salad, and desert, was displayed in
lavish hospitality. Cove etiquette evidently
demanded that no square inch of
the table-cloth should remain unoccupied.</p>

<p>Seated at the table, with hands demurely
folded, was the most grotesque
figure that Hinton had ever seen. Clad
in a queer, old-fashioned garment of
faded blue cloth, with very full skirt and
flowing sleeves, with her hair gathered
into a tight knot at the back of her head,
and a necklace of nutshells about her
neck, a strange little lady sat and
watched him with parted lips and wide,
excited eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&#8217;ll just sit here opposite my
sister,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, not attempting an
introduction, &ldquo;I&#8217;ll as usual take my
customary place at the head of the
board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was all done with great éclat, but
<a name="png.190" id="png.190"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">185</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>from the first there were unmistakable
signs of nervousness on the part of the
host. He left the table twice before the
soup was removed, once to get the napkins
which had been overlooked, and
once to persuade his sister not to put the
baked potatoes in her lap.</p>

<p>When the critical moment for the trial
of strength between him and the goose
arrived, he was not in good condition.
It was his first wrestling match with a
goose, and his technical knowledge of the
art consisted in the meager fact that the
strategic point was to become master of
the opponent&#8217;s legs. The fowl had,
moreover, by nature of its being, the advantage
of extreme slipperiness, an
expedient recognized and made use of by
the gladiators of old.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp, limited as to space, and
aware of a critical audience, rose to the
occasion, and with jaw set and the light
of conquest in his eye entered the fray.
He pushed forward, and pulled back, he
throttled, he went through facial and
bodily contortions. The match was
<a name="png.191" id="png.191"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">186</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>conducted in &ldquo;the catch hold, first down to
lose style,&rdquo; and the honors seemed
equally divided. At last, by the adroit
administration of a left-leg stroke, Mr.
Opp succeeded in throwing his adversary,
but unfortunately he threw it too
far.</p>

<p>The victory, though brilliant, was not
without its casualties. The goose, in its
post-mortem flight, took its revenge, and
the overturned cranberries sent a crimson
stain across the white cloth, giving
a sanguinary aspect to the scene.</p>

<p>When order was restored and Mr. Opp
had once more taken his seat, the little
lady in the blue dress, who had remained
quiet during the recent conflict,
suddenly raised her voice in joyous song.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Kippy,&rdquo; warned Mr. Opp, putting
a restraining hand on her arm, and
looking at her appealingly. The little
lady shrank back in her chair and her
eyes filled as she clasped his hand tightly
in both of hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I was remarking,&rdquo; Mr. Opp went
steadily on, trying to behave as if it were
<a name="png.192" id="png.192"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">187</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>quite natural for him to eat with his left
hand, &ldquo;the real value of the underground
product in this country has been
but fairly made apparent, and now that
you capitalists are coming in to take a
hold, there&#8217;s no way of forming a idea
of the ultimate result.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hinton, upon whom no phase of the
situation had been lost, came valiantly
to Mr. Opp&#8217;s rescue. He roused himself
to follow his host&#8217;s lead in the conversation;
he was apparently oblivious
to the many irregularities of the dinner.
In fact, it was one of the rare occasions
upon which Hinton took the trouble to
exert himself. Something in the dreary
old room, with its brave attempt at
cheer, in the half-witted little lady who
was making such superhuman efforts to
be good, and above all in the bombastic,
egotistical, ignorant editor who was trying
to keep up appearances against such
heavy odds, touched the best and deepest
that was in Hinton, and lifted him out of
himself. Gradually he began to take the
lead in the conversation. With great tact
<a name="png.193" id="png.193"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">188</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>he relieved Mr. Opp of the necessity of
entertaining, and gave him a chance to
eat his dinner. He told stories so simple
that even Miss Kippy loosened her hold
on her brother&#8217;s hand to listen.</p>

<p>When the sunset of the dinner in the
form of a pumpkin pie had disappeared,
the gentlemen retired to the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t you smoke?&rdquo; asked Hinton,
holding a match to his pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, &ldquo;I have
smoked occasional. It&#8217;s amazing how it
assists you in creating newspaper articles.
One of the greatest editorials I
ever turned out was when I had a cigar
in my mouth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why don&#8217;t you smoke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp glanced over his shoulders at
Aunt Tish, who, with Miss Kippy&#8217;s
doubtful assistance, was clearing the
table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t mind telling you,&rdquo; he said
confidentially, &ldquo;that up to the present
time I&#8217;ve experienced a good many business
reverses and considerable family
responsibility. I hope now in a year or
<a name="png.194" id="png.194"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">189</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>two to be able to indulge them little extra
items. The lack of money,&rdquo; he added
somewhat proudly, &ldquo;is no disgrace; but
I can&#8217;t deny it&#8217;s what you might call
limiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hinton smiled. &ldquo;I think I&#8217;ve got a
cigar somewhere about me. Here it is.
Will you try it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp didn&#8217;t care if he did, and
from the manner in which he lighted it,
and from the way in which he stood,
with one elbow on the high mantel-shelf
and his feet gracefully crossed, while he
blew curling wreaths toward the ceiling,
it was not difficult to reckon the extent
of his self-denial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you indulge much in the pleasure
of reading?&rdquo; he asked, looking at Hinton
through the cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Hinton, drawing a deep
breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s a great pastime,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp.
&ldquo;I wonder if you are familiar with this
here volume.&rdquo; He took from the shelf
&ldquo;The Encyclopedia of Wonder, Beauty,
and Wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.195" id="png.195"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">190</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Hardly a thumb-nail edition,&rdquo; said
Hinton, receiving it with both hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, it&#8217;s a remarkable work,&rdquo; said
Mr. Opp, earnestly; &ldquo;you ought to get
yourself one. Facts in the first part, and
the prettiest poetry you ever read in the
back: a dollar down and fifty cents a
month until paid for. Here, let me show
you; read that <ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 original lacks closing quote">one.&rdquo;</ins></p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&#8217;t see it,&rdquo; said Hinton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll get the lamp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Opp; it isn&#8217;t that. You
read it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp complied with great pleasure,
and having once started, he found it
difficult to stop. From &ldquo;Lord Ullin&#8217;s
Daughter&rdquo; he passed to &ldquo;Curfew,&rdquo;
hence to &ldquo;Barbara Frietchie&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Young Lochinvar,&rdquo; and as he read
Hinton sat with closed eyes and traveled
into the past.</p>

<p>He saw a country school-house, and
himself a youngster of eight competing
for a prize. He was standing on a platform,
and the children were below him,
and behind him was a row of visitors.
<a name="png.196" id="png.196"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">191</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>He was paralyzed with fear, but bursting
with ambition. With one supreme effort
he began his speech:</p>

<div class="quote">
<div class="poem">
<div>Oh, the young Lochinvar has came out of the
     west!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He got no further; a shout from the
big boys and a word from the teacher,
and he burst into tears and fled for
refuge to his mother. How the lines
brought it all back! He could feel her
arms about him now, and her cheek
against his, and hear again her words of
comfort. In all the years since she had
been taken from him he had never
wanted her so insistently as during those
few moments that Mr. Opp&#8217;s high voice
was doing its worst for the long-suffering
Lochinvar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. D.,&rdquo; said a complaining voice
from the doorway, &ldquo;Miss Kippy won&#8217;t
lemme tek her dress off to go to baid.
She &#8217;low she gwine sleep in hit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp abruptly descended from his
elocutionary flight, and asked to be excused
for a few moments.</p>

<p><a name="png.197" id="png.197"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">192</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Just a little domestic friction,&rdquo; he
assured Hinton; &ldquo;you can glance over
the rest of the poems, and I&#8217;ll be back
soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hinton, left alone, paced restlessly up
and down the room. The temporary diversion
was over, and he was once more
face to face with his problem. He went
to the table, and, taking a note from his
pocket, bent over the lamp to read it.
The lines blurred and ran together, but a
word here and there recalled the contents.
It was from Mr. Mathews, who
preferred writing disagreeable things to
saying them. Mr. Mathews, the note
said, had been greatly annoyed recently
by repeated errors in the reports of his
secretary; he was neither as rapid nor as
accurate as formerly, and an improvement
would have to be made, or a change
would be deemed advisable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Delicate tact!&rdquo; sneered Hinton,
crushing the paper in his hand. &ldquo;Courtesy
sometimes begets a request, and the
shark shrinks from conferring favors.
And I&#8217;ve got to stick it out, to go on
<a name="png.198" id="png.198"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">193</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>accepting condescending disapproval
until a &lsquo;change is deemed advisable.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He dropped his head on his arms, and
so deep was he in his bitter thoughts
that he did not hear Mr. Opp come into
the room. That gentleman stood for a
moment in great embarrassment; then he
stepped noiselessly out, and heralded his
second coming by rattling the door-knob.</p>

<p>The wind had risen to a gale, and it
shrieked about the old house and tugged
at the shutters and rattled the panes incessantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You take the big chair,&rdquo; urged Mr.
Opp, who had just put on a fresh log and
sent the flames dancing up the chimney;
&ldquo;and here&#8217;s a pitcher of hard cider
whenever you feel the need of a little refreshment.
You ain&#8217;t a married man I
would judge, Mr. Hinton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank the Lord, no!&rdquo; exclaimed
Hinton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, pursing his
lips and smiling, &ldquo;you know that&#8217;s
just where I think us young men are
making a mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.199" id="png.199"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">194</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Matrimony,&rdquo; said Hinton, &ldquo;is about
the only catastrophe that hasn&#8217;t befallen
me during my short and rocky career.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, &ldquo;I used to
feel that way, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before you met her?&rdquo; suggested
Hinton.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp looked pleased but embarrassed.
&ldquo;I can&#8217;t deny there is a young
lady,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but she is quite young
as yet. In fact, I don&#8217;t mind telling you
she&#8217;s just about half my age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hinton, instead of putting two and two
together, added eighteen to eighteen.
&ldquo;And you are about thirty-six?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, surprised.
&ldquo;I am most generally considered a long
sight younger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From matrimony the conversation
drifted to oil-wells, then to journalism,
and finally to a philosophical discussion
of life itself. Mr. Opp got beyond his
depth again and again, and at times he
became so absorbed that he gave a very
poor imitation of himself, and showed
<a name="png.200" id="png.200"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">195</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>signs of humility that were rarely if
ever visible.</p>

<p>Hinton meantime was taking soundings,
and sometimes his plummet
stopped where it started, and sometimes
it dropped to an unexpected depth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said at last, rising, &ldquo;we
must go to bed. You&#8217;ll go on climbing a
ladder in the air, and I&#8217;ll go on burrowing
like a mole in the ground, and
what is the good of it all? What chance
have either of us for coming out anywhere?
You can fool yourself; I can&#8217;t:
that&#8217;s the difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp&#8217;s unusual mental exertions
had apparently affected his entire body,
his legs were tightly wrapped about each
other, his arms were locked, and his features
were drawn into an amazing
pucker of protest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That ain&#8217;t it,&rdquo; he said emphatically,
struggling valiantly to express his conviction:
&ldquo;this here life business ain&#8217;t
run on any such small scale as that. According
to my notion, or understanding,
it&#8217;s&mdash;well&mdash;what you might call, in military
<a name="png.201" id="png.201"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">196</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>figures, a fight.&rdquo; He paused a
moment and tied himself if possible even
into a tighter knot, then proceeded
slowly, groping his way: &ldquo;Of course
there&#8217;s some that just remains around
in camp, afraid to fight and afraid to
desert, just sort of indulging in conversation,
you might say, about the rest of
the army. Then there is the cowards
and deserters. But a decent sort of
a individual, or rather soldier, carries
his orders around with him, and the
chief and principal thing he&#8217;s got to do
is to follow them. What the fight is concerning,
or in what manner the general
is a-aiming to bring it all correct in the
end, ain&#8217;t, according to my conclusion,
a particle of our business.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">Having arrived at this point of the
discussion in a somewhat heated and indignant
state, Mr. Opp suddenly remembered
his duties as host. With a lordly
wave of the hand he dismissed the subject,
and conducted Hinton in state to
his bed-chamber, where he insisted upon
lighting the fire and arranging the bed.</p>

<p class="illus pgbrk"><a name="png.202" id="png.202"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">197</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span><img src="images/illus202.jpg" width="450" height="733"
 alt="" title="" /><br
 />&ldquo;It was Mr. Opp saying his prayers&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.204" id="png.204"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">199</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Hinton sat for a long time before undressing,
listening to the wind in the
chimney, to the scrape, scrape of the
cedar on the roof, and to the yet more
dismal sounds that were echoing in his
heart. Everything about the old house
spoke of degeneration, decay; yet in the
midst of it lived a man who asked no
odds of life, who took what came, and
who lived with a zest, an abandon, a
courage that were baffling. Self-deception,
egotism, cheap optimism&mdash;could
they bring a man to this state of mind?
Hinton wondered bitterly what Opp
would do in his position; suppose his
sight was threatened, how far would his
foolish self-delusion serve him then?</p>

<p>But he could not imagine Mr. Opp,
lame, halt, or blind, giving up the fight.
There was that in the man&mdash;egotism,
courage, whatever it was&mdash;that would
never recognize defeat, that quality that
wins out of a life of losing the final victory.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">Before he retired, Hinton found there
was no drinking water in his room, and,
<a name="png.205" id="png.205"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">200</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>remembering a pitcher full in the dining-room,
he took the candle and softly
opened his door. The sudden cold draft
from the hall made the candle flare, but
as it steadied, Hinton saw that an old
cot had been placed across the door opposite
his, as if on guard, and that beside
it knelt an ungainly figure in white, with
his head clasped in his hands. It was
Mr. Opp saying his prayers.</p>



<h2 class="chap"><a name="png.206" id="png.206"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">201</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>XII</h2>


<p class="start"><img class="initial" src="images/t-initial.png"
 alt="T" title="T" width="149" height="150" /><span>he</span> visit of the capitalists
marked the beginning of
a long and profitable
spell of insomnia for the
Cove. The little town
had gotten a gnat in its
eye when Mr. Opp arrived, and now that
it had become involved in a speculation
that threatened to develop into a boom,
it found sleep and tranquillity a thing of
the past.</p>

<p>The party of investigators had found
such remarkable conditions that they
were eager to buy up the ground at once;
but they met with unexpected opposition.</p>

<p>At a meeting which will go down to
posterity in the annals of Cove City, the
Turtle Creek Land Company, piloted by
the intrepid Mr. Opp, had held its course
<a name="png.207" id="png.207"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">202</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>against persuasion, threats, and bribes.
There was but one plank in the company&#8217;s
platform, and that was a determination
not to sell. To this plank they
clung through the storm of opposition,
through the trying calm of indifference
that followed, until a truce was declared.</p>

<p>Finally an agreement was reached by
which the Turtle Creek Land Company
was to lease its ground to the capitalists,
receive a given per cent. of the oil produced,
and maintain the right to buy
stock up to a large and impossible
amount at any time during the ensuing
year.</p>

<p>Close upon this contract came men and
machinery to open up a test well. For
weeks hauling was done up the creek bottom,
there being no road leading to the
oil spring where the first drilling was to
be done.</p>

<p>The town watched the operations with
alternate scorn and interest. It was facetious
when water and quicksands were
encountered, and inclined to be sarcastic
when work was suspended on account of
<a name="png.208" id="png.208"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">203</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the weather. But one day, after the pipe
had been driven to a considerable depth
and the rock below had been drilled for
six inches, the drill suddenly fell into a
crevice, and upon investigation the hole
was found to be nearly full of petroleum.</p>

<p>The Cove promptly went into a state
of acute hysteria. Speculation spread
like the measles, breaking out in all manner
of queer and unexpected places.
Everybody who could command a dollar
promptly converted it into oil stock.
Miss Jim Fenton borrowed money from
her cousin in the city, and plunged recklessly;
the Missionary Band raffled off
three quilts and bought a share with the
proceeds; Mr. Tucker foreclosed two
mortgages on life-long friends in order
to raise more money; while the amount
of stock purchased by Mr. D.&nbsp;Webster
Opp was limited only by his credit at the
bank.</p>

<p>The one note of warning that was
sounded came from Mrs. Fallows, who
sat on the porch of Your Hotel, and, like
the Greek Chorus, foretold the disasters
<a name="png.209" id="png.209"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">204</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>that would befall, and prophesied nothing
but evil for the entire enterprise.
Even the urbane Jimmy became ruffled
by her insistent iteration, and declared
that she &ldquo;put him in mind of a darned
old whip-o&#8217;-will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mrs. Fallows&#8217;s piping note was
lost in the gale of enthusiasm. Farmers
coming into town on Saturday became
infected and carried the fever into the
country. The entire community suspended
business to discuss the exciting
situation.</p>

<p>These were champagne days for Mr.
Opp. Life seemed one long, sparkling,
tingling draft and he was drinking it to
Guinevere. If her eyes drooped and she
met his smile with a sigh, he saw it not,
for the elixir had gone to his head.</p>

<p>Compelled to find some outlet for his
energy, he took advantage of the Cove&#8217;s
unwonted animation and plunged into
municipal reform. &ldquo;The Opp Eagle&rdquo;
demanded streets, it demanded lamp-posts,
it demanded temperance. The
right of pigs to take their daily siesta in
<a name="png.210" id="png.210"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">205</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the middle of Main Street was questioned
and fiercely denied. Dry-goods
boxes, which for years had been the only
visible means of support for divers
youths of indolent nature, were held up
to such scathing ridicule that the owners
were forced to remove them.</p>

<p>The policies suggested by Mr. Opp, the
editor, were promptly acted upon by Mr.
Opp, the citizen. So indignant did he
become when he read his own editorials
that nothing short of immediate action
was to be considered. He arranged a
reform party and appointed himself
leader. Mat Lucas, he made Superintendent
of Streets; Mr. Gallop, chairman
of the Committee on City Lights. In
fact, he formed enough committees to
manage a Presidential campaign.</p>

<p>The attitude of the town toward him
was that of a large lump of dough to a
small cake of yeast. It was willing to
be raised, but doubtful of the motive
power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;d feel surer,&rdquo; said Jimmy Fallows,
&ldquo;if his intellect was the standard
<a name="png.211" id="png.211"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">206</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>size. It appears so big to him he can&#8217;t
get his language ready-made; he has to
have it made to order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But since the successful management
of the oil-wells, Mr. Opp&#8217;s opinion was
more and more considered. In the
course of a short time the office of &ldquo;The
Opp Eagle&rdquo; became the hub about which
the township revolved.</p>

<p>One afternoon in March the editor was
sitting before his deal table, apparently
in the most violent throes of editorial
composition.</p>

<p>Nick, who was impatiently waiting for
copy, had not dared to speak for an hour,
for fear of slipping a cog in the intricate
machinery of creation. The constant
struggle to supply &ldquo;The Opp Eagle&rdquo;
with sufficient material to enable it to fly
every Thursday was telling upon the
staff; he was becoming irritable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said impatiently, as Mr.
Opp finished the tenth page and gathered
the large sheets into his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, to be sure,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp,
guiltily; &ldquo;I am at your disposal. Just
<a name="png.212" id="png.212"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">207</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>finishing a little private correspondence
of a personal nature that couldn&#8217;t wait
over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&#8217;t that copy?&rdquo; demanded Nick,
fixing him with an indignant eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, uneasily.
&ldquo;The fact is, I haven&#8217;t been able to accomplish
any regular editorial this week.
Unusual pressure of outside business
and&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long is she going to stay down
in Coreyville?&rdquo; Nick asked, with a contemptuous
curl of his lip.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp paused in the act of addressing
the envelop, and gave Nick a look
that was designed to scorch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I inquire to who you refer?&rdquo;
he asked with dignity.</p>

<p>Nick&#8217;s eyes dropped, and he shuffled
his feet. &ldquo;I just wanted to put it in the
paper. We got to fill up with something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, slightly conciliated,
&ldquo;you can mention that she has
gone back to attend the spring term at
the Young Ladies&#8217; Seminary.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.213" id="png.213"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">208</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Gone back to school again?&rdquo; exclaimed
Nick, unable to control his curiosity.
&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To attend the spring term,&rdquo; repeated
Mr. Opp, guardedly. Then he added in
a burst of confidence: &ldquo;Nick, has it ever
occurred to you that Mrs. Gusty was
what you might term a peculiar woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Nick was not interested in the psychological
idiosyncrasies of the Gusty
family. &ldquo;The Opp Eagle&rdquo; was crying
for food, and Nick would have sacrificed
himself and his chief to fill the
vacancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here, Mr. Opp, do you know what
day it is? It&#8217;s Monday, and we&#8217;ve got
two columns to fill. New subscriptions
are coming in all the time. We&#8217;ve got
to live up to our reputation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Extremely well put,&rdquo; agreed Mr.
Opp; &ldquo;the reputation of the paper must
be guarded above all things. I like to
consider that after my mortal remains
has returned to dust, my name will be
perpetuated in this paper. That no monument
in marble will be necessary, so
<a name="png.214" id="png.214"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">209</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>long as &lsquo;The Opp Eagle&rsquo; continues to
circulate from home to home, and to promulgate
those&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&#8217;t you write some of it down?&rdquo;
suggested Nick; &ldquo;it would fill up a
couple of paragraphs. Part of it you
used before, but we might change it
around some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp. &ldquo;On no
consideration would I repeat myself in
print. I&#8217;ll just run through my box
here, and see what new material I have.
Here&#8217;s something; take it down as I dictate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pastor Joe Tyler is holding divine
service every second Sunday in Cove
City. He has had thirty conversions,
and on Saturday was presented with a
$20.00 suit of clothing from and by this
community, and a barrel of flour, which
fully attests what a general church
awakening will accomplish in the direction
of good. No one should think of
endeavoring to rear their children or redeem
society without the application of
the gospel twice per month.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.215" id="png.215"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">210</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Now, if you can keep that up,&rdquo; said
Nick, hopefully, &ldquo;we&#8217;ll get through in
no time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mr. Opp had gone back to his
letter, and was trying to decide whether
it would take one stamp or two. When
he felt Nick&#8217;s reproachful eye upon him,
he put the envelop resolutely in his
pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;ve already said that work would
be resumed at the oil-wells as early as
the inclemency of the weather would permit,
haven&#8217;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;ve had it in every issue since last
fall,&rdquo; said Nick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, let&#8217;s see,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp,
diving once more into his reserve box.
&ldquo;Here, take this down: &lsquo;Mr. Jet Connor
had his house burnt last month, it being
the second fire he has had in ten years.
Misfortunes never come single.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; encouraged Nick. &ldquo;Now
can&#8217;t you work up that idea about the
paper offering a prize?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp seized his brow firmly between
his palms and made an heroic effort
<a name="png.216" id="png.216"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">211</span><span class="ns">]
 </span> to concentrate his mind upon the
business at hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just wait a minute till I get it arranged.
Now write this: &lsquo;&ldquo;The Opp
Eagle&rdquo; has organized a club called the
B.B.B. Club, meaning the Busy Bottle-Breakers
Club. A handsome prize of a
valued nature will be awarded the boy or
girl which breaks the largest number
of whisky and beer bottles before the
first of May.&rsquo; The boats to Coreyville
run different on Sunday, don&#8217;t they,
Nick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick, who had unquestioningly taken
the dictation until he reached his own
name, glanced up quickly, then threw
down his pen and sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m going up to Mr. Gallop&#8217;s,&rdquo; he
said in desperation; &ldquo;he&#8217;s got his mind
on things here in town. I&#8217;ll see what he
can do for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp remorsefully allowed him to
depart, and gazed somewhat guiltily at
the unaccomplished work before him.
But instead of making reparation for
recent delinquency, he proceeded to
<a name="png.217" id="png.217"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">212</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>make even further inroads into the time
that belonged to &ldquo;The Opp Eagle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moving stealthily to the door, he
locked it, then pulled down the shade
until only a strip of light fell across his
table. These precautions having been
observed, he took from his pocket a number
of letters, and, separating a large
typewritten one from several small blue
ones, arranged the latter in a row before
him according to their dates, and proceeded,
with evident satisfaction, to read
them through twice. Then glancing
around to make quite sure that no one
had crawled through the key-hole, he
unlocked a drawer, and took out a key
which in turn unlocked a box from which
he carefully took a small object, and contemplated
it with undisguised admiration.</p>

<p>It was an amethyst ring, and in the
center of the stone was set a pearl. He
held it in the narrow strip of light, and
read the inscription engraved within:
&ldquo;Guinevere forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For Miss Guinevere Gusty, ever plastic
<a name="png.218" id="png.218"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">213</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to a stronger will, had succumbed to
the potent combination of absence and
ardor, and given her half-hearted consent
for Mr. Opp to speak to her mother.
Upon that lady&#8217;s unqualified approval
everything would depend.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp had received the letter a week
ago, and he had immediately written to
the city for a jeweler&#8217;s circular, made his
selection, and received the ring. He had
written eight voluminous and eloquent
epistles to Guinevere, but he had not yet
found the propitious moment in which to
call upon Mrs. Gusty. Every time he
started, imperative business called him
elsewhere.</p>

<p>As he sat turning the stone in the sunlight
and admiring every detail, the conviction
oppressed him that he could no
longer find any excuse for delay. But
even as he made the decision to face the
ordeal, his eye involuntarily swept the
desk for even a momentary reprieve.
The large typewritten letter arrested
his attention; he took it up and reread
it.</p>

place in your neighborhood for a man
to go blind in? I&#8217;ll be in the hospital for another
month, and after that I am to spend the
summer out of doors, in joyful anticipation of
an operation which I am assured beforehand
will probably be unsuccessful. Under the
peculiar circumstances I am not particular
about the scenery, human or natural; the
whole affair resolves itself into a matter of flies
and feather-beds. If you know of any place
where I can be reasonably comfortable, I wish
you&#8217;d drop me a line. The ideal place for me
would be a neat pine box underground, with a
dainty bunch of daisies overhead.</p>

<p class="yours">Yours gratefully,</p>

<p class="sign"><span class="smc">Willard Hinton.</span></p>

<p class="noindent">P.S. I sent you a box of my books last week.
Chuck out what you don&#8217;t want. The candy
was for your sister.</p>

</div>


<p>Mr. Opp, with the letter still in his
hand, suddenly saw a way out of his
difficulty: he would make Hinton&#8217;s request
an excuse for a call upon Mrs.
<a name="png.220" id="png.220"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">215</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Gusty. No surer road to her good
graces could he travel than by seeking
her advice.</p>

<p>Replacing the ring in the drawer and
the letters in his pocket, he buttoned up
his coat, and with a stern look of determination
went out of the office. At the
Gusty gate he encountered Val, who was
on all fours by the fence, searching for
something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s the matter, Val?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Opp. &ldquo;Lost something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Val raised a pair of mournful eyes.
&ldquo;Yas, sir; you bet I is. Done lost a
penny Mr. Jimmy Fallows gimme for
puttin&#8217; my fisty in my mouf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Putting your fist in your mouth!&rdquo;
repeated Mr. Opp, surprised. &ldquo;Can you
perform that act?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Val promptly demonstrated; but just
as he was midway, a peremptory voice
called from a rear window:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Val! You Val! You better answer
me this minute!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Val cowered lower behind the fence,
and violently motioned Mr. Opp to go on.</p>

<p><a name="png.221" id="png.221"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">216</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Is&mdash;er&mdash;is Mrs. Gusty feeling well
to-day?&rdquo; asked Mr. Opp, still lingering
at the gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jes tolerable,&rdquo; said Val, lying flat on
his back and speaking in guarded tones.
&ldquo;Whenever she gits to beatin&#8217; de carpets,
an&#8217; spankin&#8217; de beds, and shakin&#8217;
de curtains, I keeps outen de way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think&mdash;er&mdash;that&mdash;er&mdash;I better
go in?&rdquo; asked Mr. Opp, sorely in
need of moral support.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yas, sir; she&#8217;s &#8217;spectin&#8217; yer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This surprising announcement nerved
Mr. Opp to open the gate.</p>

<p>It is said that the best-drilled soldiers
dodge when they first face the firing-line,
and if Mr. Opp&#8217;s knees smote together
and his body became bathed in profuse
perspiration, it should not be attributed
to lack of manly courage.</p>

<p>In response to his knock, Mrs. Gusty
herself opened the door. The signs that
she had been interrupted in the midst of
her toilet were so unmistakable that Mr.
Opp promptly averted his eyes. A shawl
had been hastily drawn about her shoulders,
<a name="png.222" id="png.222"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">217</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>on one cheek a streak of chalk
awaited distribution, and a single bristling
curl-paper, rising fiercely from the
top of her forehead, gave her the appearance
of a startled unicorn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;ll have to excuse me, Mr. Opp,&rdquo;
she said firmly, putting the door between
them. &ldquo;I can&#8217;t come out, and you can&#8217;t
come in. Did you want anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, looking
helplessly at the blank door. &ldquo;You see,
there is a matter I have been considering
discussing with you for a number of
weeks. It&#8217;s a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it&#8217;s waited this long, I should think
it could wait till to-morrow,&rdquo; announced
the lady with decision.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp felt that his courage could
never again stand the strain of the last
few moments. He must speak now or
never.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s immediate,&rdquo; he managed to gasp
out. &ldquo;If you could arrange to give me
five or ten minutes, I won&#8217;t occupy more
than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Gusty considered. &ldquo;I am looking
<a name="png.223" id="png.223"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">218</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>for company myself at five o&#8217;clock.
That wouldn&#8217;t give you much time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ample,&rdquo; urged Mr. Opp; &ldquo;it&#8217;s just
a little necessary transaction, as it
were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Gusty reluctantly consented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go on in the parlor, then,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I&#8217;ll be in as quick as I can. You
won&#8217;t more than have time to get started,
though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp passed into the parlor and
hung his hat on the corner of a large, unframed
canvas that stood on the floor
with its face to the wall. The room had
evidently been prepared for a visitor, for
a fire was newly kindled and a vase of
flowers adorned the table. But Mr. Opp
was not making observations. He alternately
warmed his cold hands at the fire,
and fanned his flushed face with his
handkerchief. He was too nervous to
sit still, yet his knees trembled when he
moved about. It was only when he
touched the little packet of letters in
his breast pocket that his courage revived.</p>

<p><a name="png.224" id="png.224"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">219</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>At last Mrs. Gusty came in with a
rustle of garments suggestive of Sunday.
Even in his confusion Mr. Opp
was aware that there was something unusual
in her appearance. Her hair, ordinarily
drawn taut to a prim knot at the
rear, had burst forth into curls and puffs
of an amazing complexity. Moreover,
her change of coiffure had apparently
affected her spirits, for she, too, was
flurried and self-conscious and glanced
continually at the clock on the mantel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll endeavor not to intrude long on
your time,&rdquo; began Mr. Opp, politely,
when they were seated side by side on
the horse-hair sofa. &ldquo;You&mdash;er&mdash;can&#8217;t
be in total ignorance of the subject that&mdash;er&mdash;I
mean to bring forward.&rdquo; He
moistened his lips, and glanced at her for
succor, but she was adamant. &ldquo;I want
to speak with you,&rdquo; he plunged on desperately&mdash;&ldquo;that
is, I thought I had better
talk with you about Mr. Hinton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; blazed forth Mrs. Gusty in
indignant surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hinton,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, breathlessly,
<a name="png.225" id="png.225"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">220</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>&ldquo;a young friendly acquaintance
of mine. Wants to get board for the
summer, you know; would like a nice,
quiet place and all that, Mrs. Gusty. I
thought I&#8217;d consult you about it, Mrs.
Gusty, if you don&#8217;t mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She calmly fixed one eye upon him
and one upon the clock while he went
into particulars concerning Mr. Hinton.
When he paused for breath, she folded
her arms and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Opp, if you want to say what
you come to say, you haven&#8217;t got but
four minutes to do it in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, gratefully,
but helplessly; &ldquo;I was just coming to
that point. It&#8217;s a matter&mdash;that&mdash;er&mdash;well
you might say it is in a way pertaining&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guin-never!&rdquo; snapped Mrs. Gusty,
unable longer to stand his hesitation.
&ldquo;I&#8217;d have been a deaf-mute and a fool
to boot not to have known it long ago.
Not that I&#8217;ve been consulted in the matter.&rdquo;
She lifted a stiffened chin, and
turned her gaze upward.</p>

<p><a name="png.226" id="png.226"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">221</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;You have,&rdquo; declared Mr. Opp, earnestly;
&ldquo;that is, you will be. Everything
is pending on you. There has been
no steps whatever taken by Miss Guinnever
or I&mdash;rather I might say by her. I
can&#8217;t say but what I have made some
slight preliminary arrangements.&rdquo; He
paused, then went on anxiously: &ldquo;I trust
there ain&#8217;t any personal objections to
the case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Gusty made folds in her black-silk
skirt and creased them down with
her thumb-nail. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said shortly;
&ldquo;far as I can see, Guin-never would be
doing mighty well to get you. You&#8217;d be
a long sight safer than a good-looking
young fellow. Of course a man being so
much older than a girl is apt to leave her
a widow. But, for my part, I believe in
second marriages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp felt as if he had received a
hot and cold douche at the same time;
but the result was a glow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you don&#8217;t oppose it, Mrs.
Gusty,&rdquo; he cried eagerly. &ldquo;You&#8217;ll write
her you are willing?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.227" id="png.227"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">222</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gusty; &ldquo;there&#8217;s
a condition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There ain&#8217;t any condition in the
world I won&#8217;t meet to get her,&rdquo; he exclaimed
recklessly, his fervor bursting
its bounds. &ldquo;You don&#8217;t know how I feel
about that young lady. Why, I&#8217;d live
on bread and water all the rest of my
life if it would make her happy. There
hasn&#8217;t been a hour since I met her that
she hasn&#8217;t held my soul&mdash;as you might
say&mdash;in the pa&#8217;m of her hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People don&#8217;t often get it so bad at
our age,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Gusty, sarcastically,
and Mr. Opp winced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The condition,&rdquo; went on Mrs. Gusty,
&ldquo;that I spoke about, was your sister. Of
course I never would consent to Guin-never
living under the same roof with a
crazy person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hope which was carrying Mr.
Opp to the dizziest heights dropped to
earth at this unexpected shaft, and for a
moment he was too stunned to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kippy?&rdquo; he began at last, and his
voice softened at the name. &ldquo;Why, you
<a name="png.228" id="png.228"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">223</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>don&#8217;t understand about her. She&#8217;s just
similar to a little child. I told Miss
Guin-never all about her; she never
made any objections. You&mdash;you&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t
ask me to make any promises
along that line?&rdquo; Abject entreaty shone
from Mr. Opp&#8217;s eyes; it was a plea for
a change of sentence. She had asked
of him the only sacrifice in the world at
which he would have faltered. &ldquo;Don&#8217;t&mdash;don&#8217;t
put it like that!&rdquo; he pleaded,
laying his hand on her arm in his earnestness.
&ldquo;I&#8217;m all she&#8217;s got in the
world; I&#8217;ve kind of become familiar
with her ways, you know, and can manage
her. She&#8217;ll love Miss Guin-never
if I tell her to. She shan&#8217;t be a bit of
care or trouble; I and Aunt Tish will
continue on doing everything for her.
You won&#8217;t refuse your consent on that
account, will you? You&#8217;ll promise to
say yes, now won&#8217;t you, Mrs. Gusty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A slight and ominous cough in the
doorway caused them both to start. Mr.
Tucker, in widower&#8217;s weeds, but with a
jonquil jauntily thrust through his buttonhole,
<a name="png.229" id="png.229"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">224</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>stood with his hand still on the
knob, evidently transfixed by the scene
he had witnessed.</p>

<p>For a moment the company was enveloped
in a fog of such dense embarrassment
that all conversation was
suspended. Mrs. Gusty was the first to
emerge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Howdy, Mr. Tucker,&rdquo; she said, rustling
forward in welcome. &ldquo;I didn&#8217;t
think you&#8217;d get here before five. Mr.
Opp just dropped in to consult me about&mdash;about
boarding a friend of his. Won&#8217;t
you draw up to the fire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Tucker edged forward with a suspicious
eye turned upon Mr. Opp, who was
nervously searching about for his hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There it is, by the door,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Gusty, eager to speed his departure; and
as they both reached for it, the picture
upon which it hung toppled forward and
fell, face upward, on the floor. It was
the portrait of Mr. Tucker mourning
under the willow-tree which Miss Jim
had left with Mrs. Gusty for safe-keeping.</p>

<p><a name="png.230" id="png.230"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">225</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Mr. Opp went home across the fields
that evening instead of through the
town. He was not quite up to any of his
rôles&mdash;editor, promoter, or reformer.
In fact, he felt a desperate need of a brief
respite from all histrionic duties. A reaction
had set in from the excitement of
the past week, and the complication involved
in Mrs. Gusty&#8217;s condition puzzled
and distressed him. Of course, he
assured himself repeatedly, there was a
way out of the difficulty; but he was not
able to find it just yet. He had observed
that Mrs. Gusty&#8217;s opinions became fixed
convictions under the slightest opposition,
whereas Guinevere&#8217;s firmest decision
trembled at a breath of disapproval.
He sighed deeply as he meditated upon
the vagaries of the feminine mind.</p>

<p>Overhead the bare trees lifted a network
of twigs against a dull sky, a cold
wind stirred the sedge grass, and fluttered
the dry leaves that had lain all
winter in the fence corners. Everything
looked old and worn and gray, even Mr.
Opp, as he leaned against a gaunt, white
<a name="png.231" id="png.231"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">226</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>sycamore, his head bent, and his brows
drawn, wrestling with his problem.</p>

<p>Suddenly he lifted his head and listened,
then he smiled. In the tree above
him a soft but animated conversation
was in progress. A few daring birds
had braved the cold and the wind, and
had ventured back to their old trysting-place
to wait for the coming of the
spring. No hint of green had tinged the
earth, but a few, tiny, pink maple-buds
had given the secret away, and the birds
were cuddled snugly together, planning,
in an ecstasy of subdued enthusiasm, for
the joyous days to come.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp listened and understood.
They were all whispering about one
thing, and he wanted to whisper about
it, too. It was the simple theme of love
without variations&mdash;love, minus problems,
minus complications, minus consequences.
He took out his little packet of
letters and read them through; then, unmindful
of the chill, he stretched himself
under the tree and listened to the birds
until the twilight silenced them.</p>

<p><a name="png.232" id="png.232"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span

 /></span>When he reached home at last, Miss
Kippy met him at the door with a happy
cry of welcome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;D.,&rdquo; she said, with her arm through
his, and her cheek rubbing his sleeve,
&ldquo;I&#8217;ve been good. I&#8217;ve let my hair stay
up all day, and Aunt Tish is making me
a long dress like a lady.&rdquo; She looked at
him shyly and smiled, then she pulled
his head down and whispered, &ldquo;If I&#8217;m
very good, when I grow up, can I marry
Mr. Hinton?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">Miss Kippy, too, had been listening to
the bird-song.</p>

 class="pgmark">228</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>XIII</h2>


<p class="start"><img class="initial" src="images/i-initial.png"
 alt="I" title="I" width="160" height="150" /><span>t</span> was May when Willard
Hinton arrived at the
Cove and took up his
abode at Mrs. Gusty&#8217;s.
For the first week he
kept to his bed, but at
the end of that time he was able to crawl
down to the porch and, under the protection
of dark glasses and a heavy shade,
sit for hours at a time in the sunshine.
The loss of his accustomed environment,
the ennui that ensues from absolute
idleness, the consciousness that the
light was growing dimmer day by day,
combined to plunge him into abysmal
gloom.</p>

<p>He shrank from speaking to any one,
he scowled at a suggestion of sympathy,
he treated Mr. Opp&#8217;s friendly overtures
with open discourtesy. Conceiving himself
on the rack of torture, he set his
<a name="png.234" id="png.234"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">229</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>teeth and determined to submit in
silence, but without witnesses.</p>

<p>One endless day dragged in the wake
of another, and between them lay the
black strips of night that were heavy
with the suggestion of another darkness
pending. When sleep refused to come,
he would go out into the woods and walk
for hours, moody, wretched, and sick to
his innermost soul with loneliness.</p>

<p>The one thing in the whole dreary
round of existence that roused in him a
spark of interest was his hostess. She
bestowed upon him the same impersonal
attention that she gave her fowls. She
fed him and cared for him and doctored
him as she saw fit, and after these duties
were performed, she left him to himself,
pursuing her own vigorous routine in
her own vigorous way.</p>

<p>Hinton soon discovered that Mrs.
Gusty was temperamental. Her intensely
energetic nature demanded an
emotional as well as a physical outlet.
Sometime during the course of each day
she indulged in emotional fireworks,
<a name="png.235" id="png.235"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">230</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>bombs of anger, rockets of indignation,
or set pieces of sulks and pouts.</p>

<p>These periodic spells of anger acted
upon her like wine: they warmed her
vitals and exhilarated her; they made
her talk fluently and eloquently. As a
toper will accept any beverage that intoxicates,
so Mrs. Gusty accepted any
cause that would rouse her. At stated
intervals her feelings demanded a stimulant,
and obeying the call of nature, she
went forth and got angry.</p>

<p>Hinton came to consider these outbursts
as the one diversion in a succession
of monotonous hours. He tabulated
the causes, and made bets with himself
as to the strength and duration of each.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the sun and the wind and
the silence were working their miracle.
Hinton was introduced to nature by a
warlike old rooster whose Hellenic cast
of countenance had suggested the name
of Menelaus. A fierce combat with a
brother-fowl had inevitably recalled the
great fight with Paris, and upon investigation
Hinton found that the speckled
<a name="png.236" id="png.236"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">231</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>hen was Helen of Troy! This was but
the beginning of a series of discoveries,
and the result was an animated and
piquant version of Greek history, which
boldly set aside tradition, and suggested
many possibilities heretofore undreamed
of.</p>

<p>Early one morning as Hinton was
wandering listlessly about the yard he
heard the gate click, and, looking up,
saw Mr. Opp hurrying up the walk with
a large bunch of lilacs in one hand and
a cornet in the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said that gentleman,
cheerily. &ldquo;Mighty glad to see you
out enjoying the beauties of nature. I
haven&#8217;t got but a moment in which to
stop; appointment at eight-fifteen. We
are arranging for a concert soon up in
Main Street, going to practise this afternoon.
I&#8217;ll be glad to call by for you if
you feel able to enjoy some remarkable
fine selections.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hinton accepted the proffered bouquet,
but made a wry face at the invitation.</p>

<p><a name="png.237" id="png.237"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">232</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;None of your concerts for me,&rdquo; he
said brusquely. &ldquo;It would interfere too
seriously with my own musical job of
getting in tune with the infinite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mornin&#8217;, Mr. Opp,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Gusty from the dining-room window.
&ldquo;There ain&#8217;t many editors has time to
stand around and talk this time of day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just paused a moment in passing,&rdquo;
said Mr. Opp. &ldquo;Wanted to see if I
couldn&#8217;t induce our young friend here
to give us a&#8217; article for &lsquo;The Opp Eagle.&rsquo;
Any nature, you know; we are always
metropolitan in our taste. Thought
maybe he&#8217;d tell us some of his first impressions
of our city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hinton smiled and shook his head.
&ldquo;You&#8217;d better not stir up my impressions
about anything these days; I am
apt to splash mud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can stand it,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, affably.
&ldquo;If Cove City needs criticism
and rebuke, &lsquo;The Opp Eagle&rsquo; is the vehicle
to administer it. You dictate a few
remarks to my reporter, and I&#8217;ll feature
it on the front editorial column.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.238" id="png.238"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">233</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Hinton&#8217;s eyes twinkled wickedly behind
his blue glasses. &ldquo;I&#8217;ll give you an
article,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but no name is to be
signed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp, regretting the stipulation,
but pleased with the promise, was turning
to depart when Mrs. Gusty appeared
once more at the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s the matter with the oil-wells?&rdquo;
she demanded, as she dusted off
the sill. &ldquo;Why don&#8217;t they open up?
You can&#8217;t use bad weather for an excuse
any longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&#8217;t the weather,&rdquo; said Mr.
Opp, with the confident and superior
manner of one who is conversant with
the entire situation. &ldquo;This here delay
has been arranged with a purpose. I
and Mr. Mathews has a plan that will
eventually yield every stock-holder in the
Cove six to one for what he put into it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Intend selling out to a syndicate?&rdquo;
asked Hinton.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes; I don&#8217;t mind telling you
two, but it mustn&#8217;t go any farther. The
<a name="png.239" id="png.239"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">234</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>oil prospects in this region are of such a
great magnitude that we can&#8217;t command
sufficient capital to do &#8217;em justice. I
and Mr. Mathews are at present negotiating
with several large concerns with
a view to selling out the entire business
at a large profit. You can&#8217;t have any
conception of the tac&#8217; and patience it
takes to manage one of these large
deals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was that man Clark that was
down here last week?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Gusty,
impressed, in spite of herself, at being
taken into the confidence of such a man
of affairs.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp&#8217;s face clouded. &ldquo;Now that
was a very unfortunate thing about
Clark. He was sent down by the Union
Syndicate of New York city to make a
report on the region, and he didn&#8217;t get
the correct ideas in the case at all. If
they hadn&#8217;t sent such a poor man, the
whole affair might have been settled by
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&#8217;t his report favorable?&rdquo;
asked Hinton.</p>

<p><a name="png.240" id="png.240"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">235</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;He hasn&#8217;t made it yet,&rdquo; said Mr.
Opp; &ldquo;but he let drop sundry casual remarks
to me that showed he wasn&#8217;t a
man of fine judgment at all. I went
over the ground with him, and pointed
out some of the places where we calculated
on drilling; but he was so busy
making measurements and taking notes
that he didn&#8217;t half hear what I was saying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He stayed at Our Hotel,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Gusty. &ldquo;Mr. Tucker said he had as
mean a face as ever he looked into.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who said so?&rdquo; asked Hinton.</p>

<p>She tossed her head and flipped her
duster at him, but it was evident that she
was not displeased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, Mr. Opp,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;I&#8217;m thinking about letting Guin-never
come home week after next. Guess you
ain&#8217;t sorry to hear that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the contrary, Mr. Opp was overcome
with joy. Letters were becoming
less and less satisfying, and the problem
suggested by Mrs. Gusty was still waiting
solution.</p>

<p><a name="png.241" id="png.241"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">236</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;If you&#8217;ll just mention the date,&rdquo; he
said, trying to keep his countenance
from expressing an undue amount of
rapture, &ldquo;I&#8217;ll make a business trip
down to Coreyville on purpose to accompany
her back home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mrs. Gusty declined to be explicit.
She deemed it unwise to allow a mere
man to know as much as she did upon
any given subject.</p>

<p>Hinton&#8217;s editorial appeared in the
next issue of &ldquo;The Opp Eagle.&rdquo; It was
a clever and cutting satire on the impressions
of a foreigner visiting America for
the first time. Hinton interviewed himself
concerning his impressions of the
Cove. He approached the subject with
great seriousness, handling village
trifles as if they were municipal cannon-balls.
He juggled with sense and nonsense,
with form and substance. The result
shot far over the heads of the country
subscribers, and hit the bull&#8217;s-eye of a
big city daily.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp&#8217;s excitement was intense
when he found that an editorial from
<a name="png.242" id="png.242"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">237</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>&ldquo;The Opp Eagle&rdquo; had been copied in a
New York paper. The fact that it was
not his own never for a moment dimmed
the glory of the compliment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are getting notorious,&rdquo; he said
exultingly to Hinton. &ldquo;There are few,
if any, papers that in less than a year
has extended its influence as far as the
Atlantic Ocean. Now I am considering
if it wouldn&#8217;t be a wise and judicious
thing to get you on the staff permanent&mdash;while
you are here, that is. Of course
you understand I am invested up pretty
close; but I&#8217;d be willing to let you have
a little of my oil stock in payment for
services.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hinton laughingly shook his head.
&ldquo;Whenever you run short of material,
you can call on me. The honor of seeing
my humble efforts borne aloft on the
wings of &lsquo;The Opp Eagle&rsquo; will be sufficient
reward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having once conceived it as a favor
that was in his power to bestow, Mr.
Opp lost no opportunity for inviting
contributions from the aspiring author.</p>

<p><a name="png.243" id="png.243"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">238</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>As Hinton&#8217;s strength returned, Mr.
Opp adopted him as a protégé, at first
patronizing him, then consulting him,
and finally frankly appealing to him.
For during the long afternoon walks
which they got into the habit of taking
together, Mr. Opp, in spite of bluster
and brag and evasion, found that he was
constantly being embarrassed by a question,
a reference, a statement from his
young friend. It was the first time
he had ever experienced any difficulty in
keeping his head above the waves of his
own ignorance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said one day by way of
explanation, &ldquo;my genius was never
properly tutored in early youth. It&#8217;s
what some might regard as a remarkable
brain that could cope with all the
different varieties of enterprises that I
have engaged in, with no instruction or
guidance but just the natural elements
that God give it in the beginning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But in spite of Mr. Opp&#8217;s lenient attitude
toward his intellectual short-comings,
it was evident that upon the serene
<a name="png.244" id="png.244"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">239</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>horizon of his egotism small clouds of
humility were threatening to gather.</p>

<p>Hinton, restlessly seeking for something
to fill the vacuum of his days,
found Mr. Opp and his paper a growing
source of diversion. &ldquo;The Opp Eagle,&rdquo;
at first an object of ridicule, gradually
became a point of interest in his limited
range of vision. Under his suggestions
it was enlarged and improved, and
induced to publish news not strictly
local.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp, meanwhile, was buzzing as
persistently and ineffectually as a fly on
a window-pane. The night before
Guinevere&#8217;s return, he found that, in
order to accomplish all that he was committed
to, it would be necessary to spend
the night at the office.</p>

<p>The concert for which the Unique Orchestra
had been making night hideous
for two weeks had just come to a successful
close, and the editor found himself
at a late hour tramping out the
lonely road that led to the office with the
prospect of a couple of hours&#8217; work to
<a name="png.245" id="png.245"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">240</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>do before he could seek a well-earned
rest upon the office bench.</p>

<p>He was flushed with his double triumph
as director and cornet soloist, and
still thrilled by the mighty notes he had
breathed into his beloved instrument.</p>

<p>The violin sobs, the flute complains,
the drum insists, but the cornet brags,
and Mr. Opp found it the instrument
through which he could best express himself.</p>

<p>It was midnight, and the moon, one
moment shining brightly and the next
lost behind a flying cloud, sent all sorts
of queer shadows scurrying among the
trees. Mr. Opp thought once that he saw
the figure of a man appear and disappear
in the road before him, but he was
so engrossed in joyful anticipation of
the morrow that he gave the incident no
attention. As he was passing the Gusty
house, he was rudely plunged from sentiment
into suspicion by the sight of a
figure stealthily moving along the wall
beneath the front windows.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp crouched behind the fence to
<a name="png.246" id="png.246"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">241</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>watch him, but the moon took that inopportune
moment to sink into a bank of
clouds, and the yard was left in darkness.
No sound broke the stillness save
the far-off bark of a dog or an occasional
croak from a bullfrog. Mr. Opp waited
and listened in a state of intense suspense.
Presently he heard the unmistakable
sound of a window being
cautiously raised, and then just as cautiously
lowered. Summoning all his
courage, he skirted the yard and hid in
the bushes near the house. Nothing was
to be seen or heard. He watched for a
light at any of the windows, but none
came.</p>

<p>The rash desire to capture the burglar
single-handed, and thus distinguish himself
in the eyes of Guinevere&#8217;s mother,
caused Mr. Opp to stiffen his knees and
assume a fierce and determined expression.
But he was armed only with his
cornet, which, though often deadly as an
instrument of attack, has never been
recognized as a weapon of defense.
There seemed no alternative but to
<a name="png.247" id="png.247"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">242</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>waken Hinton and effect a simultaneous
attack from within and without.</p>

<p>After throwing a few unsuccessful
pebbles at Hinton&#8217;s window, Mr. Opp
remembered a ladder he had seen at the
back of the barnyard. Shaking as if
with the ague, but breathing dauntless
courage, he departed in great excitement
to procure it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately another party was in
possession. A dozen guinea-fowls were
roosting on the rungs, and when he gave
them to understand they were to vacate
they raised an outcry that would have
quelled the ardor of a less valiant knight.</p>

<p>But the romantic nature of the adventure
had fired Mr. Opp&#8217;s imagination.
He already saw himself lightly dusting
his hands after throttling the intruder,
and smiling away Mrs. Gusty&#8217;s solicitude
for his safety. Meanwhile he staggered
back to the house with his burden,
dodging fearfully at every shadow, and
painfully aware that his heart was beating
a tattoo on his ear-drums.</p>

<p>Placing the ladder as quietly as possible
<a name="png.248" id="png.248"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">243</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>under Hinton&#8217;s window, he cautiously
began the ascent. The sudden
outburst of the guineas had set his
nerves a-quiver, and what with his
breathless condition, and a predisposition
to giddiness, he found some difficulty
in reaching the sill. When at last
he succeeded, he saw, by the light of the
now refulgent moon, the figure of Hinton
lying across the foot of the bed,
dressed, but asleep. The opening not
being sufficiently large to admit him, he
thrust in his head and whispered
hoarsely through his chattering teeth:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hinton! I say, Hinton, there&#8217;s a
burglar in the house!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hinton started up, and stared dully at
the excited apparition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; whispered Mr. Opp, dramatically,
lifting a warning hand. &ldquo;I&#8217;ve
been tracking the scoundrel for half an
hour. He&#8217;s in the house now. We&#8217;ll
surround him. We&#8217;ll bind him hand
and foot. You get the front door open,
and I&#8217;ll meet you on the outside. It&#8217;s
all planned; just do as I say.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.249" id="png.249"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">244</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Hinton, who was springing for the
door, paused with his hand on the knob.
&ldquo;What&#8217;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Gusty&#8217;s commanding
tones from a front window: &ldquo;He&#8217;s
round at the side of the house. He&#8217;s
been after my guineas! I saw him a
minute ago going across the yard with
a ladder. Shoot him if you can. Shoot
him in the leg, so he can&#8217;t get away.
Quick! Quick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp had only time to turn from
the window when he felt the ladder
seized from below and jerked violently
forward. With a terrific crash he came
down with it, and found himself locked
in a close struggle with the supposed
burglar. To his excited imagination his
adversary seemed a Titan, with sinews
of steel and breath of fire. The combatants
rolled upon the ground and fought
for possession of each other&#8217;s throats.
The conflict, while fierce, was brief.
As Hinton and Mrs. Gusty rushed
around the corner of the house, the fighters
shouted in unison, &ldquo;I&#8217;ve got him!&rdquo;
<a name="png.250" id="png.250"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">245</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and Mr. Opp, opening one swollen eye,
gazed down into the mild but bloody features
of little Mr. Tucker!</p>

<p>With the instinct that always prompted
him to apologize when any one bumped
into him, he withdrew his hands immediately
from Mr. Tucker&#8217;s throat and
began vehement explanations. But Mr.
Tucker still clung to his collar, sputtering
wrathful ejaculations. Mrs. Gusty,
wrapped in a bed-quilt, and with her unicorn
horn at its most ferocious angle,
held the lamp on high while Hinton
rushed between the belligerents.</p>

<p>Excited and incoherent explanations
followed, and it was not until Mr. Opp,
who was leaning limply against a tree,
regained his breath that the mystery
was cleared up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will just listen here at me a
moment,&rdquo; he implored, holding a handkerchief
to his bruised face. &ldquo;We are
one and all laboring under a grave error.
It&#8217;s my belief that there ain&#8217;t any
burglar whatsoever here at present.
Mr. Hinton forgot his key and had to
<a name="png.251" id="png.251"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">246</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>climb in the window. I mistaken him
for the burglar, and Mrs. Gusty, here,
from what she relates, mistaken me for
him, and not knowing Mr. Hinton had
come in, telephoned our friend Mr.
Tucker, and me and Mr. Tucker might
be said, in a general way, to have mistaken
each other for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pretty mess to get us all into!&rdquo;
exclaimed Mrs. Gusty. &ldquo;A man made
his fortune once &#8217;tending to his own
business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mrs. Gusty&mdash;&rdquo; began Mr. Opp,
indignantly.</p>

<p>Hinton interrupted. &ldquo;You would better
put something on that eye of yours.
It will probably resemble a Whistler
&lsquo;Nocturne&rsquo; by morning. What are you
looking for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The object lost proved to be Mr. Opp&#8217;s
cherished cornet, and the party became
united in a common cause and joined in
the search. Some time elapsed before
the horn was found under the fallen ladder,
having sustained internal injuries
which subsequently proved fatal.</p>

of &ldquo;The Opp Eagle,&rdquo; the editor was
watching for it. He was waiting to welcome
the day that would bring back
Guinevere. As Hope with blindfold eyes
bends over her harp and listens to the
faint music of her one unbroken string,
so Mr. Opp, with bandaged head, bent
over his damaged horn and plaintively
evoked the only note that was left
therein.</p>

the coy goddess of happiness
through the mazes
of the labyrinth of life,
know well how she invites
her victim on from point
to point, only to evade capture at the end.
Mr. Opp rose with each summer dawn,
radiant, confident, and expectant, and
each night he sat in his window with his
knees hunched, and his brows drawn,
and wrestled with that old white-faced
fear.</p>

<p>Two marauders were harassing the
editor these days, dogging his footsteps,
and snapping at him from ambush. One
was the wolf that howls at the door, and
the other was the monster whose eyes
are green.</p>

<p><a name="png.254" id="png.254"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">249</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Since the halcyon days that had
wafted Miss Guinevere Gusty back to the
shore of the Cove, Mr. Opp had not
passed a serene hour out of her presence.
His disposition, though impervious
to the repeated shafts of unkind
fortune, was not proof against the corrosive
effect of jealousy.</p>

<p>If he could have regarded Willard
Hinton in the light of a hated rival, and
met him in fair and open fight, the situation
would have been simplified. But
Hinton was the friend of his bosom, the
man who, he had declared to the town,
&ldquo;possessed the grandest intelligence he
had ever encountered in a human mind.&rdquo;
He admired him, he respected him, and,
in direct contradiction to the emotion
that was consuming him, he trusted him.</p>

<p>Concerning Miss Guinevere Gusty&#8217;s
state of mind, Mr. Opp permitted himself
only one opinion. He fiercely denied
that she was absent-minded and listless
when alone with him; he refused to believe
his own eyes when he saw a light
in her face when she looked at Hinton
<a name="png.255" id="png.255"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">250</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>that was never there for him. He preferred
to exaggerate to himself her
sweetness, her gentleness, her loyalty,
demanding nothing, and continuing to
give all.</p>

<p>His entire future happiness, he assured
himself, hung upon the one question
of little Miss Kippy. For four months
the problem had been a matter for daily,
prayerful consideration, but he was still
in the dark.</p>

<p>When he was with Guinevere the solution
seemed easy. In explaining away
the difficulties to her, he explained them
away to himself, also. It was only a
matter of time, he declared, before the
oil-well would yield rich profit. When
that time arrived, he would maintain
two establishments, the old one for Miss
Kippy, and a new and elegant one for
themselves. Mr. Opp used the hole in
the ground as a telescope through which
he viewed the stars of the future.</p>

<p>But when he was alone with Kippy,
struggling with her whims, while he tried
to puzzle out the oldest and most universal
<a name="png.256" id="png.256"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">251</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of conundrums,&mdash;that of making
ends meet,&mdash;the future seemed entirely
blotted out by the great blank wall of
the present.</p>

<p>The matter was in a way complicated
by the change that had come over Miss
Kippy herself. Two ideas alternately
depressed and elated her. The first was
a fixed antipathy to the photograph of
Miss Guinevere Gusty which Mr. Opp
had incased in a large hand-painted
frame and installed upon his dresser.
At first she sat before it and cried, and
later she hid it and refused for days to
tell where it was. The sight of it made
her so unhappy that Mr. Opp was obliged
to keep it under lock and key. The other
idea produced a different effect. It had
to do with Hinton. Ever since his visit
she had talked of little else. She pretended
that he came to see her every day,
and she spread her doll dishes, and repeated
scraps of his conversation, and
acted over the events of the dinner at
which he had been present. The short
gingham dresses no longer pleased her;
<a name="png.257" id="png.257"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">252</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>she wanted long ones, with flowing
sleeves like the blue merino. She tied
her hair up in all manner of fantastic
shapes, and stood before the glass smiling
and talking to herself for hours.
But there were times when her mind
paused for a moment at the normal, and
then she would ask frightened, bewildered
questions, and only Mr. Opp could
soothe and reassure her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;D.,&rdquo; she said one night suddenly,
&ldquo;how old am I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp, whose entire mental and
physical powers were concentrated upon
an effort to put a new band on his old
hat, was taken off his guard. &ldquo;Twenty-six,&rdquo;
he answered absently.</p>

<p>A little cry brought him to her side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she whispered, shivering away
from him, yet clinging to his sleeve,
&ldquo;that&#8217;s a lady that&#8217;s grown up!
Ladies don&#8217;t play with dolls. But I want
to be grown up, too. D., why am I different?
I want to be a lady; show me
how to be a lady!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp gathered her into his arms,
<a name="png.258" id="png.258"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">253</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>along with his hat, a pair of scissors, and
a spool of thread.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t, Kippy!&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;Now,
don&#8217;t cry like that! You are getting on
elegant. Hasn&#8217;t brother D. learned you
to read a lot of pieces in your first
reader? And ain&#8217;t we going to begin on
handwriting next? Wouldn&#8217;t you like
to have a slate, and a sponge to rub out
with?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In an instant her mood veered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a basket?&rdquo; she cried eagerly.
&ldquo;The children carry a basket, too. I see
them when I peep through the shutters.
Can I have a basket, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The network of complexities that was
closing in upon Mr. Opp apparently affected
his body more than his spirits.
He seemed to shrivel and dwindle as the
pressure increased; but the fire in his
eyes shone brighter than before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of his folks live long over
forty,&rdquo; said Mrs. Fallows, lugubriously;
&ldquo;they sorter burn themselves out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hinton, meanwhile, utterly unaware
of being the partial cause of the seismic
<a name="png.259" id="png.259"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">254</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>disturbance in the editorial bosom, pursued
the monotonous routine of his days.
It had taken him only a short time to
adapt himself to the changes that the return
of the daughter of the house had
brought about. He had anticipated her
arrival with the dread a nervous invalid
always feels toward anything that may
jolt him out of his habitual rut. He held
a shuddering remembrance of her musical
accomplishments, and foresaw with
dread the noisy crowd of young people
she might bring about the house.</p>

<p>But Guinevere had slipped into her
place, an absent-minded, dreamy, detached
damsel, asserting nothing, claiming
nothing, bending like a flower in the
high winds of her mother&#8217;s wrath.</p>

<p>Hinton watched the dominating influence
nip every bud of individuality that
the girl ventured to put forth, and he determined
to interfere. During the long
months he had spent with Mrs. Gusty
he had discovered a way to manage her.
The weak spot in her armor was pride
of intellect; she acknowledged no man
<a name="png.260" id="png.260"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">255</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>her superior. By the use of figurative
language, and references to esoteric
matters, he was always able to baffle and
silence her. His joy in handling her in
one of her tempers was similar to that
of controlling a cat-boat in squally
weather. Both experiences redounded
to his masculine supremacy.</p>

<p>One hot August day, he and Mrs.
Gusty had just had an unusually sharp
round, but he had succeeded, by alternate
compliment and sarcasm, in reducing
her to a very frustrated and baffled condition.</p>

<p>It was Sunday, the day the Cove
elected for a spiritual wash-day. In
the morning the morals of the community
were scrubbed and rinsed in the
meeting-house, and in the afternoon they
were hung out on the line to dry. The
heads of the families sat in their front
yards and dutifully tended the children,
while their wives flitted from house to
house, visiting the sick and the afflicted,
and administering warnings to the delinquent.
It was a day in which Mrs.
<a name="png.261" id="png.261"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">256</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Gusty&#8217;s soul reveled, and she demanded
that Guinevere&#8217;s soul should revel likewise.</p>

<p>It was with the determination that
Guinevere should occasionally be allowed
the privilege of following her own
inclinations that Hinton hurled himself
into the breach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll go, Mother,&rdquo; said Guinevere;
&ldquo;but it&#8217;s so hot. We went to see everybody
last Sunday. I thought I&#8217;d rather
stay home and read, if you didn&#8217;t
mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Gusty tossed her head in disgust,
and turned to Hinton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, ain&#8217;t that a Gusty for you! I
never saw one that didn&#8217;t want to set
down to the job of living. Always
moping around with their nose in a book.
I never was a reader, never remember
wasting a&#8217; hour on a book in my life, and
yet I never saw the time that I wasn&#8217;t
able to hold my own with any Gusty
living.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In short,&rdquo; said Hinton, sympathetically,
&ldquo;to quote a noted novelist, you
<a name="png.262" id="png.262"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">257</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>have never considered it necessary to
add the incident of learning to the accident
of brains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Gusty tied her bonnet-strings in
a firmer knot as she looked at him uncertainly,
then, not deigning to cast another
glance in the direction of her daughter,
who was disappearing up the stairs,
swept out of the house.</p>

<p>Hinton looked at his watch; it was not
yet two o&#8217;clock. The afternoon threatened
to be a foretaste of eternity. He
went out on the porch and lay in the
hammock, with his hands clasped across
his eyes. He could no longer see to read
or to write. The doctor said the darkness
might close in now at any time,
after that the experiment of an operation
would be made, and there was one
chance in a hundred for the partial
restoration of the sight.</p>

<p>Having beaten and bruised himself
against the bars of Fate, he now lay exhausted
and passive in the power of his
jailer. He had tried to run his own life
in his own way, and the matter had been
<a name="png.263" id="png.263"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">258</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>taken out of his hands. He must lie still
now and wait for orders from headquarters.
The words of Mr. Opp, spoken in
the low-ceiled, weird old dining-room,
came vividly back to him: &ldquo;What the
fight is concerning, or in what manner
the general is a-aiming to bring it all correct
in the end, ain&#8217;t, according to my
conclusion, a particle of our business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Hinton, after a year of rebellion
and struggle and despair, had at last acknowledged
a superior officer and declared
himself ready to take whatever
orders came.</p>

<p>As he lay in the hammock he turned
his head at every noise within the house,
and listened. He had become amazingly
dependent upon a soft, drawling voice
which day after day read to him for
hours at a time. At first he had met
Guinevere&#8217;s offers of help with moody
irritability.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray, don&#8217;t bother about me,&rdquo; he
had said. &ldquo;I am quite able to look after
myself; besides, I like to be alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But her unobtrusive sympathy and
<a name="png.264" id="png.264"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">259</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>childish frankness soon conquered his
pride. She read to him from books she
did not understand, played games with
him, and showed him new walks in the
woods. And incidentally, she revealed
to him her struggling, starving, wistful
soul that no one else had ever discovered.</p>

<p>She never talked to him of her love
affair, but she dwelt vaguely on the
virtues of duty and loyalty and self-sacrifice.
The facts in the case were
supplied by Mrs. Gusty.</p>

<p>Hinton looked at his watch again, and
groaned when he found it was only a
quarter past two. Feeling his way cautiously
along the porch and down the
steps, he moved idly about the yard. He
could not distinguish Menelaus from
Paris now, and Helen of Troy was no
longer to be recognized.</p>

<p>At long intervals a vehicle rattled
past, leaving a cloud of dust behind.
The air shimmered with the heat, and
the low, insistent buzzing of bees beat
on his ears mercilessly. He wondered
<a name="png.265" id="png.265"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">260</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>impatiently why Guinevere did not come
down, then checked himself as he remembered
the constant demands he
made upon her time.</p>

<p>At three o&#8217;clock he could stand it no
longer. He felt a queer, dull sensation
about his head, and he constantly drew
his hand across his eyes to dispel the impression
of a mist before them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Guinevere!&rdquo; he called up
to her window. &ldquo;Would you mind coming
down just for a little while!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guinevere&#8217;s head appeared so
promptly that it was evident it had been
lying on the window-sill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it time for your medicine?&rdquo; she
asked guiltily. &ldquo;Mother said it didn&#8217;t
come till four.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Hinton, with forced
cheerfulness; &ldquo;it isn&#8217;t that. You remember
the old song, don&#8217;t you, &lsquo;When
a man&#8217;s afraid, a beautiful maid is a
cheering sight to see&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She disappeared from the window,
and in a moment joined him behind the
screen of honeysuckles on the porch.
<a name="png.266" id="png.266"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">261</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>The hammock hung, inviting ease, but
neither of them took it. She sat primly
on the straight-backed, green settee, and
he sat on the step at her feet with his hat
pulled over his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an infernal nuisance I have
been to you!&rdquo; he said ruefully; &ldquo;but no
more than I have been to myself. The
only difference was that I had to stand
it, and you stood it out of the goodness
of that kind little heart of yours. Well,
it&#8217;s nearly over now; I&#8217;m expecting to
go to the city any day. I guess you&#8217;ll
not be sorry to get rid of me, will you,
Miss Guinevere?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead of answering, she drew a quick
breath and turned her head away.
When she did speak, it was after a long
pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like the way you say my name.
Nobody says it like that down here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guinevere?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>She nodded. &ldquo;When you say it like
that, I feel like I was another person.
It makes me think of flowers, and poetry,
and the wind in the trees, and all those
<a name="png.267" id="png.267"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">262</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>things I&#8217;ve been reading you out of your
books. Guin-never and Guinevere <em>don&#8217;t</em>
seem the same at all, do they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They aren&#8217;t the same,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and you aren&#8217;t the same girl I met on
the boat last March. I guess we&#8217;ve both
grown a bit since then. You know I was
rather keen on dying about that time,&mdash;&lsquo;in
love with easeful death,&rsquo;&mdash;well, now
I am not keen about anything, but I am
willing to play the game out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They sat in silence for a while, then he
said slowly, without raising his eyes: &ldquo;I
am not much good at telling what I feel,
but before I go away I want you to know
how much you&#8217;ve helped me. You have
been the one light that was left to show
me the way down into the darkness.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">A soft touch on his shoulder made him
lift his head. Guinevere was bending
toward him, all restraint banished from
her face by the compassion and love that
suffused it.</p>

<p class="illus pgbrk"><a name="png.268" id="png.268"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span

 alt="" title="" /><br
 />&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, my God, it has come&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instinctively he swayed toward her, all
the need of her crying out suddenly
within him, then he pulled himself
<a name="png.270" id="png.270"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">265</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>sharply together, and, resolutely thrusting
his hands in his pockets, rose and
took a turn up and down the porch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mind reading to me a little?&rdquo;
he asked at length. &ldquo;There are forty
devils in my head to-day, all hammering
on the back of my eyeballs. I&#8217;ll get my
Tennyson; you like him better than you
do the others. Wait; I&#8217;m going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she was up the steps before him,
eager to serve, and determined to spare
him every effort.</p>

<p>Through the long afternoon Guinevere
read, stumbling over the strange words
and faltering through the difficult passages,
but vibrant to the beauty and the
pathos of it all. On and on she read, and
the sun went down, and the fragrance of
dying locust bloom came faintly from
the hill, and overhead in the tree-tops
the evening breeze murmured its world-old
plaint of loneliness and longing.</p>

<p>Suddenly Guinevere&#8217;s voice faltered,
then steadied, then faltered again, then
without warning she flung her arms
across the back of the bench, and, dropping
<a name="png.271" id="png.271"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">266</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>her head upon them, burst into passionate
sobs.</p>

<p>Hinton, who had been sitting for a
long time with his hands pressed over
his eyes, sprang up to go to her.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&ldquo;Guinevere,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what&#8217;s the
matter? Don&#8217;t cry, dear!&rdquo; Then, as he
stumbled, a look of terror crossed his
face and he caught at the railing for
support. &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; he asked
sharply. &ldquo;Speak to me! Give me your
hand! I can&#8217;t see&mdash;I can&#8217;t&mdash;oh, my
God, it has come!&rdquo;</p>

many before the summer

thing in the world is an exhausted enthusiasm,
and when weeks slipped into
months, and notes fell due, and the bank
became cautious about lending money, a
spirit of distrust got abroad, and a financial
frost settled upon the community.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these conditions,
&ldquo;The Opp Eagle&rdquo; persistently screamed
prosperity. It attributed the local depression
to the financial disturbance that
had agitated the country at large, and
assured the readers that the Cove was
on the eve of the greatest period in its
history.</p>

pretty well over before we become aware
of it, in a major sense. &lsquo;The Opp Eagle&rsquo;
has in the past, present, and future
waged noble warfare against the calamity
jays. Panic or no panic, Cove City
refuses to remain in the backgrounds.
There has been a large order for job-work
in this office within the past ten
days, also several new and important
subscribers, all of which does not make
much of a showing for hard times, at
least not from our point of looking at
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But in the same issue, in an inconspicuous
corner, were a couple of lines
to the effect that &ldquo;the editor would be
glad to take a load of wood on subscription.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The truth was that it required all of
Mr. Opp&#8217;s diplomacy to rise to the
occasion. The effort to meet his own
obligations was becoming daily more
<a name="png.274" id="png.274"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">269</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>embarrassing, and he was reduced to
economies entirely beneath the dignity
of the editor of &ldquo;The Opp Eagle.&rdquo; But
while he cheerfully restricted his diet to
two meals a day, and wore shirt-fronts
in lieu of the genuine article, he was,
according to Nick&#8217;s ideas, rashly extravagant
in other ways.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you go and buy Widow
Green&#8217;s oil-shares back for?&rdquo; Nick demanded
upon one of these occasions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; explained Mr. Opp,
&ldquo;it was purely a business proposition.
Any day, now, things may open up in a
way that will surprise you. I have good
reason to believe that those shares are
bound to go up; and besides,&rdquo; he added
lamely in an undertone, &ldquo;I happen to
know that that there lady was in immediate
need of a little ready money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So are we,&rdquo; protested Nick; &ldquo;we
need every cent we can get for the paper.
If we don&#8217;t get ahead some by the first
of the year, we are going under, sure as
you live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp laid a hand upon his shoulder
<a name="png.275" id="png.275"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">270</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and smiled tolerantly. &ldquo;Financiers get
used to these fluctuations in money circles.
Don&#8217;t you worry, Nick; you leave
that to the larger brains in the concern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But in spite of his superior attitude of
confidence, Nick&#8217;s words rankled in his
mind, and the first of the year became a
time which he preferred not to consider.</p>

<p>One day in September the mail-packet
brought two letters of great importance
to Mr. Opp. One was from Willard
Hinton, the first since his operation, and
the other was from Mr. Mathews, stating
that he would arrive at the Cove that day
to lay an important matter of business
before the stock-holders of the Turtle
Creek Land Company.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp rushed across the road, a letter
in each hand, to share the news with
Guinevere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s as good as settled,&rdquo; he cried,
bursting in upon her, where she sat at
the side door wrestling with a bit of
needlework. &ldquo;Mr. Mathews will be here
to-day. He is either going to open up
work or sell out to a syndicate. I&#8217;m
<a name="png.276" id="png.276"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">271</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>going to use all my influence for the latter;
it&#8217;s the surest and safest plan.
Miss Guin-never,&rdquo;&mdash;his voice softened,&mdash;
&ldquo;this is all I been waiting for to make
my last and final arrangement with your
mother. It was just yesterday she was
asking me what I&#8217;d decided to do, and I
don&#8217;t mind telling you, now it&#8217;s all over,
I never went to bed all last night&mdash;just
sat up trying to figure it out. But this
will settle it. I&#8217;ll be in a position to
have a little home of my own and take
care of Kippy, too. I don&#8217;t know as I
ever was so happy in all my life put
together before.&rdquo; He laughed nervously,
but his eyes anxiously studied her
averted face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there&#8217;s more news,&rdquo; he
plunged on, when she did not speak&mdash;&ldquo;a
letter from Mr. Hinton. I thought
maybe you&#8217;d like to hear what he had
to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guinevere&#8217;s scissors dropped with a
sharp ring on the stepping-stone below,
and as they both stooped to get them,
their fingers touched. Mr. Opp ardently
<a name="png.277" id="png.277"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">272</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>seized her hand in both of his, but unfortunately
he seized her needle as well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am so sorry!&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Wait, let me do it,&rdquo; and with a compassion
which he considered nothing short
of divine she extricated the needle, and
comforted the wounded member. Mr.
Opp would have gladly suffered the fate
of a St. Sebastian to have elicited such
sympathy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;is Mr. Hinton better?&rdquo; she
asked, still bending over his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hinton?&rdquo; asked Mr. Opp. &ldquo;Oh, I
forgot; yes. I&#8217;ll read you what he says.
He got his nurse to write this for him.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">Dear Opp</span>: The die is cast; I am a has-been.
I did not expect anything, so I am not disappointed.
The operation was what they called
successful. The surgeon, I am told, did a
very brilliant stunt; something like taking
my eyes out, playing marbles with them, and
getting them sewed back again all in three
minutes and a half. The result to the patient
is of course purely a minor consideration,
but it may interest you to know that I
can tell a biped from a quadruped, and may

able to distinguish faces.</p>

<p>With these useful and varied accomplishments
I have decided to return to the Cove.
My modest ambition now is to get out of the
way, and the safest plan is to keep out of the
current.</p>

<p>You will probably be a Benedick by the
time I return. My heartiest congratulations
to you and Miss Guinevere. Words cannot
thank either of you for what you have done
for me. All I can say is that I have tried to
be worthy of your friendship.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Opp avoided looking at her as he
folded the sheets and put them back in
the envelop. The goal was bright before
his eyes, but quicksands dragged at his
feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he <em>will</em> find us married, won&#8217;t
he, Miss Guin-never? You&#8217;ll be ready
just as soon as I and your mother come
to a understanding, won&#8217;t you? Why,
it seems more like eleven years than
<a name="png.279" id="png.279"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">274</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>eleven months since you and me saw that
sunset on the river! There hasn&#8217;t been
a day since, you might say, that hasn&#8217;t
been occupied with you. All I ask for
in the world is just the chance for the
rest of my life of trying to make you
happy. You believe that, don&#8217;t you,
Miss Guin-never?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said miserably, gazing out
at the little arbor Hinton had made for
her beneath the trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&#8217;ll stop by this evening after
the meeting, if it ain&#8217;t too late,&rdquo; said
Mr. Opp. &ldquo;You&#8217;ll&mdash;you&#8217;ll be&mdash;glad
if everything culminates satisfactory,
won&#8217;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m glad of everything good that
comes to you,&rdquo; said Guinevere so earnestly
that Mr. Opp, who had lived on
a diet of crumbs all his life, looked at
her gratefully, and went back to the office
assuring himself that all would be well.</p>

<p>The visit of Mr. Mathews, while
eagerly anticipated, could not have fallen
on a less auspicious day. Aunt Tish, the
arbiter of the Opp household, had been
<a name="png.280" id="png.280"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">275</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>planning for weeks to make a visit to
Coreyville, and the occasion of an opportune
funeral furnished an immediate excuse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, <em>sir</em>, Mr. D., I can&#8217;t put hit off till
to-morrow,&rdquo; she declared in answer to
Mr. Opp&#8217;s request that she stay with
Miss Kippy until after the stock-holders&#8217;
meeting. &ldquo;I&#8217;s &#8217;bleeged to go on dat
night boat. De funeral teks place at ten
o&#8217;clock in de mawnin&#8217;, an&#8217; I&#8217;s gwine be
dar ef I has to swim de ribber.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was he a particular friend, the one
that died?&rdquo; asked Mr. Opp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friend? Bunk Bivens? Dat onery,
good-fer-nothin&#8217; ole half-strainer? Naw,
sir; he ain&#8217;t no friend ob mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what makes you so pressing
and particular about attending his
funeral?&rdquo; asked Mr. Opp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8217;Ca&#8217;se I &#8217;spise him so. I been hating
dat nigger fer pretty nigh forty year,
an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t gwine lose dis chanst ob seein&#8217;
him buried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Aunt Tish,&rdquo; persisted Mr. Opp,
impatiently, &ldquo;I&#8217;ve got a very important
<a name="png.281" id="png.281"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">276</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and critical meeting this afternoon. The
business under consideration may be
wound up in the matter of a few minutes,
and then, again, it may prolong
itself into several consecutive hours.
You&#8217;ll have to stay with Kippy till I get
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman looked at him
strangely. &ldquo;See dis heah hole in my
haid, honey? &#8217;Member how you and Ben
uster ast Aunt Tish what mek hit? Dat
nigger Bunk Bivens mek hit. He was a
roustabout on de ribber, an&#8217; him an&#8217; yer
paw fell out, an&#8217; one night when you was
a baby he follow yer paw up here, an&#8217; me
an&#8217; him had hit out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where was my father?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Opp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dey was &#8217;sputin&#8217; right heah in dis
heah kitchen where we&#8217;s standin&#8217; at, an&#8217;
dat mean, bow-laigged nigger didn&#8217;t
have no better manners den to &#8217;spute wif
a gentleman dat was full. An&#8217; pore Miss
she run in so skeered an&#8217; white an&#8217; she
say, &lsquo;Aunt Tish, don&#8217;t let him hurt him;
he don&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s sayin&#8217;,&rsquo; she
<a name="png.282" id="png.282"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">277</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>baig, an&#8217; I tell her to keep yer paw outen
de way an&#8217; I tek keer ob Bunk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did he fight you?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Opp, indignantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw, sir; I fit him. We put nigh
tore up de floor ob de kitchen. Den he
bust my haid open wif de poker, an&#8217;
looks lak I been losing my knowledge
ever sence. From dat day I &#8217;low I&#8217;s
gwine to git even if it took me till I died,
an&#8217; now dat spiteful old devil done died
fust. But I&#8217;s gwine see him buried. I
want to see &#8217;em nail him up in a box and
th&#8217;ow dirt on him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aunt Tish ended the recital in a sing-song
chant, worked up to a state of hysteria
by the recital of her ancient wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp sighed both for the past and
the present. He saw the futility of arguing
the case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&#8217;ll stay until the boat whistles?&rdquo;
he asked. &ldquo;Sometimes it is two
hours late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yas, sir; but when dat whistle toots
I&#8217;s gwine. Ef you is heah, all right; ef
you ain&#8217;t, all right: I&#8217;s <em>gwine</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.283" id="png.283"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">278</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>As Mr. Opp passed through the hall he
saw Miss Kippy slip ahead of him and
conceal herself behind the door. She
carried something hidden in her apron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you learned your reading lesson
to say to brother D. to-night?&rdquo; he
asked, ignoring her behavior. &ldquo;You are
getting so smart, learning to read handwriting
just as good as I can!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Miss Kippy only peeped at him
through the crack in the door and refused
to be friendly. For several days
she had been furtive and depressed, and
had not spoken to either Aunt Tish or
himself.</p>

<p>On the way to his office Mr. Opp was
surprised to see Mr. Gallop leaning out
of the window of his little room beckoning
frantically. It was evident that Mr.
Gallop had a secret to divulge, and Mr.
Gallop with a secret was as excited as a
small bird with a large worm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just come in a minute and sit down,&rdquo;
he fluttered; &ldquo;you&#8217;ll have to excuse the
looks of things. Having just this one
<a name="png.284" id="png.284"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">279</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>room for telegraph office and bedroom
and everything crowds me up awful.
I&#8217;ve been trying to fix my lunch for half
an hour, but the telephone just keeps me
busy. Then, besides, Mr. Mathews was
here; he came down on the launch at
twelve o&#8217;clock. Now, of course I know it
ain&#8217;t right to repeat anything I hear over
the long-distance wire, but being such a
good friend of yours, and you being such
a friend of mine&mdash;why, Mr. Opp there
ain&#8217;t anybody in the world I owe more to
than I do to you, not only the money
you&#8217;ve lent me from time to time, but
your standing up for me when everybody
was down on me&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but you was remarking about
Mr. Mathews?&rdquo; Mr. Opp interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and I was saying I never make
a practice of repeating what I hear, but
he was talking right here in the room,
and I was mixing up a little salad dressing
I promised Mrs. Fallows for the
social,&mdash;it&#8217;s to be over at Your Hotel
this evening&mdash;there&#8217;s the telephone!&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.285" id="png.285"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">280</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Mr. Opp sat on the edge of the sofa,
the rest of it being occupied with gaily
embroidered sofa pillows, specimens, the
town declared, of Mr. Gallop&#8217;s own
handiwork. In fact, the only unoccupied
space in the room was on the ceiling, for
between his duties as operator and
housekeeper Mr. Gallop still found time
to cultivate the arts, and the result of his
efforts was manifest in every nook and
corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Mrs. Gusty getting after Mr.
Toddlinger for sending vanilla extract
instead of lemon,&rdquo; explained Mr. Gallop,
who had stopped to hear the discussion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as I was saying, Mr. Mathews
called up somebody in the city almost as
soon as he got here&mdash;Now you&#8217;ve got to
promise me you won&#8217;t tell a living soul
about this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp promised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said to telegraph New York
party that terms were agreed on, and to
mail check at once to Clark, and tell him
to keep his mouth shut. Then the other
end said something, and Mr. Mathews
<a name="png.286" id="png.286"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">281</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>said: &lsquo;We can&#8217;t afford to wait. You
telegraph at once; I&#8217;ll manipulate the
crowd down here.&rsquo; They talked a lot
more, then he said awful low, but I heard
him: &lsquo;Well, damn it! they&#8217;ve got to.
There&#8217;s too much at stake.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The editor sat with his hat in his hand,
and blinked at the operator: &ldquo;Manipulate,&rdquo;
he said in a puzzled tone, &ldquo;did he
use that particular word?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Gallop nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He may have been referring to something
else,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, waiving aside
any disagreeable suspicion. &ldquo;Mr. Mathews
is a business gentleman. He&#8217;s
involved in a great many ventures,
something like myself. You wouldn&#8217;t
think from what you heard that&mdash;er&mdash;that
he was contemplating not acting exactly&mdash;fair
with us, would you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Gallop, having delivered himself
of his information, did not feel called
upon to express a personal opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you ever say I told you a word of
this, I&#8217;ll swear I didn&#8217;t,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It
was just because you were such a good
<a name="png.287" id="png.287"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">282</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>friend, and&mdash;there&#8217;s that &#8217;phone
again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the early hours of the afternoon,
Mr. Opp was oppressed with a
vague uneasiness. He made several attempts
to see Mr. Mathews, but that
gentleman was closeted with his stenographer
until five o&#8217;clock, the hour named
for the meeting.</p>

<p>All feeling of distrust was banished,
however, when Mr. Mathews made his
way through the crowd of stock-holders
that filled the office of Your Hotel, and
took his stand by the desk. He was so
bland and confident, so satisfied with
himself and the world and the situation,
that, as Jimmy Fallows remarked, &ldquo;You
kinder looked for him to purr when he
wasn&#8217;t talking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He set forth at great length the undoubted
oil wealth of the region, he complimented
them on their sagacity and
foresight in buying up the Turtle Creek
ground, he praised the Cove in general
and that distinguished citizen, the editor
of &ldquo;The Opp Eagle,&rdquo; in particular. The
<a name="png.288" id="png.288"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">283</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>enterprise upon which they had embarked,
he said, had grown to such proportions
that large capital was required
to carry it on. Owing to the recent depression
in the money market, the Kentucky
company did not feel able properly
to back the concern, so it had been agreed
that if a good offer was made to buy it,
it should be accepted. It was with such
an offer, Mr. Mathews said, that he had
come to them to-day.</p>

<p>A stir of excitement met this announcement,
and Miss Jim Fenton waved
her lace scarf in her enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some time ago,&rdquo; went on Mr. Mathews,
graciously acknowledging the applause,
&ldquo;the Union Syndicate of New
York sent an expert, Mr. Clark, down
here to report on the oil conditions in
this region.&rdquo; Mr. Opp&#8217;s eyes became
fixed on Mr. Mathews&#8217;s face, and his lips
parted. &ldquo;The report was so entirely
satisfactory,&rdquo; continued Mr. Mathews,
&ldquo;that the following offer has been
made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp rose immediately. &ldquo;Excuse
<a name="png.289" id="png.289"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">284</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>me, sir, there is&mdash;er&mdash;rather, there must
be some little mistake just at this juncture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All eyes were turned upon him, and a
murmur of dissent arose at an interruption
at such a critical point.</p>

<p>Mr. Mathews gave him permission to
proceed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see&mdash;I&mdash;Mr. Clark, that is,&rdquo;&mdash;Mr.
Opp&#8217;s fingers were working nervously
on the back of the chair before
him,&mdash;&ldquo;him and myself went over the
ground together, and&mdash;I&mdash;well, I must
say I don&#8217;t consider him a competent
judge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Mathews smiled. &ldquo;I am afraid,
Mr. Opp, that your opinion is overruled.
Mr. Clark is a recognized authority, although,&rdquo;
he added significantly, &ldquo;of
course the most expert make mistakes at
times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That ain&#8217;t the point,&rdquo; persisted Mr.
Opp; &ldquo;it&#8217;s the conflicting difference in
what he said to me, and what he&#8217;s reported
to them. He told me that he
didn&#8217;t consider our prospects was worth
<a name="png.290" id="png.290"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">285</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>a picayune, and if the wells were drilled,
they probably wouldn&#8217;t run a year. I
didn&#8217;t believe him then; but you say
now that he is a expert and that he
knows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Mathews&#8217;s tolerance seemed limitless.
He waited patiently for Mr. Opp
to finish, then he said smoothly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; I understand your point
perfectly, Mr. Opp. Mr. Clark&#8217;s remarks
were injudicious, but he was looking
at all sides of the question. He saw
me after he saw you, you know, and I
was able to direct his attention to the
more favorable aspects of the case. His
report was entirely favorable, and I
guess that is all that concerns us, isn&#8217;t
it?&rdquo; He embraced the room with his
smile.</p>

<p>During the next quarter of an hour
Mr. Opp sat with his arms folded and
his eyes bent on the floor and bit his lips
furiously. Something was wrong. Again
and again he fought his way back to this
conclusion through the enveloping mazes
of Mr. Mathews&#8217;s plausibility. Why
<a name="png.291" id="png.291"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">286</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>had they waited so long after drilling
that first well? Why, after making elaborate
plans and buying machinery, had
they suddenly decided to sell? Why had
Mr. Clark given such contradictory opinions?
What did Mr. Mathews mean by
that message from Mr. Gallop&#8217;s office?
Mr. Opp&#8217;s private affairs, trembling in
the balance, were entirely lost sight of
in his determination for fair play.</p>

<p>Covering his eyes with his hand, and
trying not to hear the flood of argument
which Mr. Mathews was bringing to
bear upon his already convinced audience,
Mr. Opp attempted to recall all that
Mr. Gallop had told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said &lsquo;manipulate,&rsquo;&rdquo; repeated
Mr. Opp to himself. &ldquo;I remember that,
and he said &lsquo;telegraph New York party
that terms were agreed on.&rsquo; Then he
said &lsquo;mail check to Clark; tell him to
keep his mouth shut.&rsquo; What&#8217;s <em>he</em> paying
Clark for? Why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The motion before the house,&rdquo; Mr.
Tucker&#8217;s piping voice broke in upon his
agitated reasoning, &ldquo;is whether the
<a name="png.292" id="png.292"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">287</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>stock-holders of the Turtle Creek Land
Company is willing to sell out at a rate
of seven to one to the Union Syndicate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the buzz of delight that ensued, Mr.
Opp found himself standing on a chair
and demanding attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen here,&rdquo; he cried, pounding on
the wall with his hand, &ldquo;I&#8217;ve got important
information that&#8217;s got to be told:
that man Clark is a rascal. He&#8217;s&mdash;he&#8217;s
deceiving his company. He&#8217;s been paid
to make a good report of our ground. I
can&#8217;t prove it, but I know it. We&#8217;re
taking part in a fraud; we&#8217;re&mdash;we&#8217;re
being manipulated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp almost shrieked the last word
in his agony of earnestness; but before
the crowd could fully apprehend his
meaning, Mr. Mathews rose and said
somewhat sharply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the representative of the
Union Syndicate is, or is not, doesn&#8217;t
concern us in the least. I come to you
with a gilt-edged proposition; all I ask
you is to sit tight, and take my advice,
and I guarantee you an immediate
<a name="png.293" id="png.293"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">288</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>return of seven dollars to every one you
put into this concern. Mr. Chairman,
will you put it to the vote?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mr. Opp again stopped proceedings.
&ldquo;As a director in this company I
won&#8217;t stand for what&#8217;s going on. I&#8217;ll
telegraph the syndicate. I&#8217;ll advertise
the whole matter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat Lucas pulled at his sleeve, and the
preacher put a restraining arm about his
shoulder. The amazing rumor had become
current that the Cove&#8217;s stanchest
advocate for temperance had been indulging
in drink, and there was nothing
in the editor&#8217;s flushed face and excited
manner to contradict the impression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If by any chance,&rdquo; Mr. Mathews
went on in a steady voice, &ldquo;there should
be a stock-holder who is unwilling to take
advantage of this magnificent offer, we
need hardly say that we are prepared to
buy his stock back at the amount he gave
for it.&rdquo; He smiled, as if inviting ridicule
at the absurdity of the proposition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am unwilling,&rdquo; cried Mr. Opp,
<a name="png.294" id="png.294"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">289</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>tugging at the restraining hands. &ldquo;I have
never yet in all the length and breadth
of my experience been associated with a
dishonest act.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t! Mr. Opp, don&#8217;t!&rdquo; whispered
Mat Lucas. &ldquo;You&#8217;re acting like a crazy
man. Don&#8217;t you see you are losing the
chance to make three thousand dollars?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That hasn&#8217;t nothing to do with it,&rdquo;
cried Mr. Opp, almost beside himself.
&ldquo;I&#8217;ll not be a party to the sale. I&#8217;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Mathews turned to his secretary.
&ldquo;Just fix up those papers for Mr. Opp,
and give him a check for what is coming
to him. Now, Mr. Chairman, will you
put the matter to the vote?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amid the hilarious confusion that succeeded
the unanimous vote, and the subsequent
adjournment of the meeting, Mr.
Opp pushed his way through the crowd
that surrounded Mr. Mathews.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know what I was alluding at,&rdquo;
he shouted through his chattering teeth.
&ldquo;You&#8217;ve carried this through, but I&#8217;ll
blockade you. I am going to tell the
truth to the whole community. I am
<a name="png.295" id="png.295"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">290</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>going to telegraph to the syndicate and
stop the sale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Mathews lifted his brows and
smiled deprecatingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry you have worked yourself
up to such a pitch, my friend,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Telegraph, by all means if it will ease
your mind; but the fact is, the deal was
closed at noon to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">The long, low whistle of the packet
sounded, but Mr. Opp heeded it not. He
was flinging his way across to the telegraph
office in a frenzy of Quixotic impatience
to right the wrong of which he
had refused to be a part.</p>



<h2 class="chap"><a name="png.296" id="png.296"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span

<p class="start"><img class="initial" src="images/h-initial.png"
 alt="H" title="H" width="151" height="150" /><span>alf</span> an hour later, Mr. Opp
dragged himself up the
hill to his home. All the
unfairness and injustice
of the universe seemed
pressing upon his heart.
Every muscle in his body quivered in remembrance
of what he had been through,
and an iron band seemed tightening
about his throat. His town had refused
to believe his story! It had laughed in
his face!</p>

<p>With a sudden mad desire for sympathy
and for love, he began calling
Kippy. He stumbled across the porch,
and, opening the door with his latch-key,
stood peering into the gloom of the room.</p>

<p>The draft from an open window blew
a curtain toward him, a white spectral,
<a name="png.297" id="png.297"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">292</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>beckoning thing, but no sound broke the
stillness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kippy!&rdquo; he called again, his voice
sharp with anxiety.</p>

<p>From one room to another he ran,
searching in nooks and corners, peering
under the beds and behind the doors,
calling in a voice that was sometimes a
command, but oftener a plea: &ldquo;Kippy!
Kippy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last he came back to the dining-room
and lighted the lamp with shaking
hands. On the hearth were the remains
of a small bonfire, with papers scattered
about. He dropped on his knees and
seized a bit of charred cardboard. It
was a corner of the hand-painted frame
that had incased the picture of Guinevere
Gusty! Near it lay loose sheets of
paper, parts of that treasured package
of letters she had written him from
Coreyville.</p>

<p>As Mr. Opp gazed helplessly about the
room, his eyes fell upon something white
pinned to the red table-cloth. He held it
to the light. It was a portion of one of
<a name="png.298" id="png.298"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">293</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Guinevere&#8217;s letters, written in the girl&#8217;s
clear, round hand:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Mother says I can never marry you until
Miss Kippy goes to the asylum.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Opp got to his feet. &ldquo;She&#8217;s read
the letter,&rdquo; he cried wildly; &ldquo;she&#8217;s
learned out about herself! Maybe she&#8217;s
in the woods now, or down on the bank!&rdquo;
He rushed to the porch. &ldquo;Kippy!&rdquo; he
shouted. &ldquo;Don&#8217;t be afraid! Brother D.&#8217;s
coming to get you! Don&#8217;t run away,
Kippy! Wait for me! Wait!&rdquo; and
leaving the old house open to the night,
he plunged into the darkness, beating
through the woods and up and down the
road, calling in vain for Kippy, who lay
cowering in the bottom of a leaking skiff
that was drifting down the river at the
mercy of the current.</p>

<p class="tb">Two days later, Mr. Opp sat in the office
of the Coreyville Asylum for the Insane
and heard the story of his sister&#8217;s wanderings.
Her boat had evidently been
<a name="png.299" id="png.299"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">294</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>washed ashore at a point fifteen miles
above the town, for people living along
the river had reported a strange little
woman, without hat or coat, who came to
their doors crying and saying her name
was &ldquo;Oxety,&rdquo; and that she was crazy,
and begging them to show her the way
to the asylum. On the second day she
had been found unconscious on the steps
of the institution, and since then, the
doctor said, she had been wild and unmanageable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Considering all things,&rdquo; he concluded,
&ldquo;it is much wiser for you not to
see her. She came of her own accord,
evidently felt the attack coming on, and
wanted to be taken care of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was a large, smooth-faced man,
with the conciliatory manner of one who
regards all his fellow-men as patients in
varying degrees of insanity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&#8217;m in the regular habit of taking
care of her,&rdquo; protested Mr. Opp.
&ldquo;This is just a temporary excitement
for the time being that won&#8217;t ever, probably,
occur again. Why, she&#8217;s been
<a name="png.300" id="png.300"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">295</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>improving all winter; I&#8217;ve learnt her to
read and write a little, and to pick out
a number of cities on the geographical
atlas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All wrong,&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor;
&ldquo;mistaken kindness. She can never be
any better, but she may be a great deal
worse. Her mind should never be stimulated
or excited in any way. Here, of
course, we understand all these things
and treat the patient accordingly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I must just go back to treating
her like a child again?&rdquo; asked Mr. Opp,
&ldquo;not endeavoring to improve her intellect,
or help her grow up in any way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor laid a kindly hand on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You leave her to us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
State provides this excellent institution
for just such cases as hers. You do
yourself and your family, if you have
one, an injustice by keeping her at home.
Let her stay here for six months or so,
and you will see what a relief it will be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp sat with his elbow on the
desk and his head propped in his hand,
<a name="png.301" id="png.301"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">296</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and stared miserably at the floor. He
had not had his clothes off for two
nights, and he had scarcely taken time
from his search to eat anything. His
face looked old and wizened and haunted
from the strain. Yet here and now he
was called upon to make his great decision.
On the one hand lay the old, helpless
life with Kippy, and on the other a
future of dazzling possibility with Guinevere.
All of his submerged self suddenly
rose and demanded happiness. He
was ready to snatch it, at any cost, regardless
of everything and everybody&mdash;of
Kippy; of Guinevere, who, he knew,
did not love him, but would keep her
promise; of Hinton, whose secret he had
long ago guessed. And, as a running
accompaniment to his thoughts, was the
quiet, professional voice of the doctor
urging him to the course that his heart
prompted. For a moment the personal
forces involved trembled in equilibrium.</p>

<p>After a long time he unknotted his fingers,
and drew his handkerchief across
his brow.</p>

<p><a name="png.302" id="png.302"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">297</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;I guess I&#8217;ll go up and see her now,&rdquo;
he said, with the gasping breath of a man
who has been under water.</p>

<p>In vain the doctor protested. Mr.
Opp was determined.</p>

<p>As the door to the long ward was being
unlocked, he leaned for a moment
dizzily against the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;d better let me give you a swallow
of whisky,&rdquo; suggested the doctor,
who had noted his exhaustion.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp raised his hand deprecatingly,
with a touch of his old professional
pride. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t know as I&#8217;ve had
occasion to mention,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I
am the editor and sole proprietor of &lsquo;The
Opp Eagle&rsquo;; and that bird,&rdquo; he added,
with a forced smile, &ldquo;is, as everybody
knows, a complete teetotaler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the end of the crowded ward, with
her face to the wall, was a slight, familiar
figure. Mr. Opp started forward; then
he turned fiercely upon the attendant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her hands are <ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'tired'">tied</ins>! Who dared to
tie her up like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s just a soft handkerchief,&rdquo;
<a name="png.303" id="png.303"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">298</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>replied the matronly woman, reassuringly.
&ldquo;We were afraid she would pull her hair
out. She wants its fixed a certain way;
but she&#8217;s afraid for any of us to touch
her. She has been crying about it ever
since she came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In an instant Mr. Opp was on his
knees beside her. &ldquo;Kippy, Kippy darling,
here&#8217;s brother D.; he&#8217;ll fix it for
you! You want it parted on the side,
don&#8217;t you, tied with a bow, and all the
rest hanging down? Don&#8217;t cry so,
Kippy. I&#8217;m here now; brother D.&#8217;ll
take care of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She flung her loosened arms around
him and clung to him in a passion of relief.
Her sobs shook them both, and his
face and neck were wet with her tears.</p>

<p>As soon as they could get her sufficiently
quiet, they took her into her little
bedroom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You let the lady get you ready,&rdquo;
urged Mr. Opp, still holding her hand,
&ldquo;and I&#8217;ll take you back home, and Aunt
Tish will have a nice, hot supper all waiting
for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.304" id="png.304"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">299</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>But she would let nobody else touch
her, and even then she broke forth into
piteous sobs and protests. Once she
pushed him from her and looked about
wildly. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I mustn&#8217;t
go; I am crazy!&rdquo; But he told her about
the three little kittens that had been born
under the kitchen steps, and in an instant
she was all a-tremble with eagerness to
go home to see them.</p>

<p>An hour later, Mr. Opp and his charge
sat on the river-bank and waited for the
little launch that was to take them back
to the Cove. A curious crowd had gathered
at a short distance, for their story
had gone the rounds.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp sat under the fire of curious
glances, gazing straight in front of him,
and only his flushed face showed what he
was suffering. Miss Kippy, in her
strange clothes and with her pale hair
flying about her shoulders, sat close by
him, her hand in his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;D.,&rdquo; she said once in a high, insistent
voice, &ldquo;when will I be grown up
enough to marry Mr. Hinton?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.305" id="png.305"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">300</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Mr. Opp for a moment forgot the
crowd. &ldquo;Kippy,&rdquo; he said with all the
gentle earnestness that was in him, &ldquo;you
ain&#8217;t never going to grow up at all. You
are just always going to be brother D.&#8217;s
little girl. You see, Mr. Hinton&#8217;s too
old for you, just like&mdash;&rdquo; he paused, then
finished it bravely&mdash;&ldquo;just like I am too
old for Miss Guin-never. I wouldn&#8217;t be
surprised if they got married with each
other some day. You and me will just
have to take care of each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him with the quick suspicion
of the insane, but he was ready for
her with a smile.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&ldquo;Oh, D.,&rdquo; she cried, in a sudden rapture,
&ldquo;we are glad, ain&#8217;t we?&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="chap"><a name="png.306" id="png.306"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">301</span><span class="ns">]<br

<p class="start"><img class="initial" src="images/f-initial.png"
 alt="F" title="F" width="157" height="150" /><span>or</span> the next four weeks
there was no issue of
&ldquo;The Opp Eagle.&rdquo; When
it did make its appearance,
it contained the
following editorial:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Ye editor has for several weeks been the
victim of the La Grip which eventuated into a
rising in our left ear. Although we are still
in severe and continuous pain, we know that
behind the clouds of suffering the blue sky of
health is still shining, and that a brighter day
is coming, as it were.</p>
</div>

<p>The night of Mr. Opp&#8217;s return from
Coreyville, he had written a long letter
to Guinevere Gusty telling her of his
final decision in regard to Kippy, and
releasing her from her promise. This
having been accomplished, he ceased to
<a name="png.307" id="png.307"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">302</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>fight against the cold and exhaustion,
and went to bed with a hard chill.</p>

<p>Aunt Tish, all contrition for the disasters
she thought she had brought upon
the household, served him night and day,
and even Miss Kippy, moved by the unusual
sight of her brother in bed, made
futile efforts to assist in the nursing.</p>

<p>When at last he was able to crawl back
to the office, he found startling changes
had taken place in the Cove. The
prompt payment of the oil stock-holders
by the Union Syndicate had brought
about such a condition of prosperity and
general satisfaction as had never before
been known. The civic spirit planted
and carefully nourished by &ldquo;The Opp
Eagle&rdquo; burst into bloom under this sudden
and unexpected warmth. Committees,
formed the year before, were called
upon for reports, and gratifying results
were obtained. The Cove awoke to the
fact that it had lamp-posts, and side-walks
and a post-office, with a possibility,
looming large, of a court house.</p>

<p>Nor did this ambition for improvement
<a name="png.308" id="png.308"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">303</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>stop short with the town: it extended to
individuals. Jimmy Fallows was going
to build a new hotel; Mr. Tucker was
going to convert his hotel into a handsome
private residence, for which Mrs.
Gusty had been asked to select the wall-paper;
Mat Lucas was already planning
to build a large store on Main Street,
and had engaged Mr. Gallop to take
charge of the dry-goods department.
The one person upon whom prosperity
had apparently had a blighting effect
was Miss Jim Fenton. Soon after the
receipt of her check, she had appeared
in the Cove in a plain, black tailor suit,
and a small, severe felt hat innocent of
adornment. The French-heeled slippers
had been replaced by heavy walking
shoes, and the lace scarf was discarded
for a stiff linen collar.</p>

<p>But the state of Miss Jim&#8217;s mind was
not to be judged by the somberness of
her raiment. The novelty of selecting
her own clothes, of consulting her own
taste, of being rid of the entangling dangers
of lace ruffles and flying furbelows,
<a name="png.309" id="png.309"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">304</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to say nothing of unwelcome suitors,
gave her a sense of exhilaration and independence
which she had not enjoyed
for years.</p>

<p>In the midst of all these tangible evidences
of success, Mr. Opp found himself
indulging in a hand-to-hand struggle
with failure. As a hunter aims at a point
well in advance of the flying bird, so he
had aimed at possibilities ahead of the
facts, and when events took an unexpected
turn, he was left stranded, his
ammunition gone, his judgment questioned,
and his hands empty. He had
been conducting his affairs not on the
basis of his present income, but in reference
to the large sums which he confidently
believed would accrue from the
oil-wells.</p>

<p>The circulation of &ldquo;The Opp Eagle&rdquo;
was increasing steadily, but the growing
bird must be fed, and the editor, struggling
to meet daily pressing obligations,
was in no condition to furnish the steady
demand for copy.</p>

<p>All unnecessary diversions were
<a name="png.310" id="png.310"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">305</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>ruthlessly foregone. He resigned with a
pang the leadership of the Union Orchestra,
he gave up his membership with the
Odd Fellows. Even his more important
duties, as president of the Town Improvement
League, and director in the
bank, were relinquished. For, in addition
to his editorials, he had undertaken
to augment his slender income by selling
on subscription the &ldquo;Encyclopedia of
Wonder, Beauty, and Wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was at this low ebb of Mr. Opp&#8217;s
fortunes that Willard Hinton returned
to the Cove. He was still pale from his
long confinement, but there was an unusual
touch of animation about him, the
half-surprised interest of one who has
struck bottom, and found it not so bad
as he had expected.</p>

<p>One dark afternoon in November he
made his way over to the office of &ldquo;The
Opp Eagle,&rdquo; and stood irresolute in the
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you, Mr. Opp? Or is it Nick?&rdquo;
He blinked uncertainly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it is me,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp.
<a name="png.311" id="png.311"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">306</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>&ldquo;Come right in. I&#8217;ve been so occupied
with engagements that I haven&#8217;t
scarcely had occasion to see anything
of you since you come back. You are
getting improved all the time, ain&#8217;t
you? I thought I saw you writing on
a type-writer when I passed this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Hinton; &ldquo;it&#8217;s a little machine
I got before I came down, with
raised letters on the keyboard. If I progress
at the rapid pace I have started,
I&#8217;ll be an expert before long. Mrs.
Gusty was able to read five words out
of ten this morning!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope you&#8217;ll do us an article or
two,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t mind telling
you that things has been what you
might name as pressing ever since that
trouble about the oil-wells. I&#8217;m not regretting
any step that I taken, and I am
endeavoring not to harbor any feelings
against those that went on after I give
my word it wasn&#8217;t a fair transaction.
But if what that man Clark said is true,
Mr. Hinton, the Union Syndicate will
<a name="png.312" id="png.312"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">307</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>never open up another well in this community.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your conscience proved rather an
expensive luxury that time, didn&#8217;t it,
Mr. Opp?&rdquo; asked Hinton, who had heard
as many versions of the affair as there
were citizens in the Cove.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp shrugged his shoulders, and
pursed his lips. &ldquo;It&#8217;s a matter that I
cannot yet bring myself to talk about.
After a whole year and more of associating
with me in business and social ways,
to think they wouldn&#8217;t be willing to take
my word for what I said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it wasn&#8217;t to their advantage,&rdquo;
said Hinton, smiling. &ldquo;You forget the
amount of money involved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; declared Mr. Opp with some
heat, &ldquo;you do those gentlemen a injustice.
There ain&#8217;t a individual of them
that is capable of a dishonest act, any
more than you or me. They just lacked
the experience in dealing with a man like
Mr. Mathews.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hinton&#8217;s smile broadened; he reached
over and grasped Mr. Opp&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p><a name="png.313" id="png.313"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">308</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Do you know you are a rattling good
fellow? I am sorry things have gotten
so balled up with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll pay out,&rdquo; said the editor.
&ldquo;It&#8217;ll take some time, but I&#8217;ve got a remarkable
ability for work in me. I don&#8217;t
mind telling you, though I&#8217;ll have to ask
you not to mention the fact to no one at
present, that I am considering inventing
a patent. It&#8217;s a sort of improved type-setter,
one of the most remarkable
things you ever witnessed. I never
knew till about six months ago what a
scientific turn my mind could take.
I&#8217;ve worked this whole thing out in
my brain without the aid of a model of
any sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the meanwhile,&rdquo; said Hinton, &ldquo;I
hear you will have to sell your paper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp winced, and the lines in his
face deepened. &ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I have about decided to sell, provided
I keep the editorship, of course. After
my patent gets on the market I will soon
be in a position to buy it back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Opp,&rdquo; said Hinton, &ldquo;I&#8217;ve got a
<a name="png.314" id="png.314"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">309</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>proposition to make to you. I have a
moderate sum of money in bank which I
want to invest in business. How would
you like to sell out the paper to me, lock,
stock, and barrel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp, whose eyes had been resting
on the bills that strewed his table,
looked up eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You to own it, and me to run it?&rdquo; he
asked hopefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hinton; &ldquo;you would help
me to run it, I hope, but I would be the
editor. I have thought the matter over
seriously, and I believe, with competent
help, I can make the paper an up-to-date,
self-supporting newspaper, in spite of
my handicap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp sat as if stunned by a blow.
He had known for some time that he
must sell the paper in order to meet his
obligations, but the thought of relinquishing
his control of it never dawned
upon him. It was the pride of his heart,
the one tangible achievement in a wilderness
of dreams. Life without Guinevere
had seemed a desert; life without &ldquo;The
<a name="png.315" id="png.315"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">310</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Opp Eagle&rdquo; seemed chaos. He looked
up bewildered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;d continue on doing business
here in the regular way?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hinton; &ldquo;I would build a
larger office uptown, and put in new
presses; we could experiment with your
new patent type-setter as soon as you got
it ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mr. Opp was beyond pleasantries.
&ldquo;You&#8217;d keep Nick?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I
wouldn&#8217;t consider anything that would
cut Nick out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; said Hinton. &ldquo;I&#8217;m
counting on you and Nick to initiate me
into the mysteries of the profession.
You could be city editor, and Nick&mdash;well,
we could make him foreman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One last hope was left to Mr. Opp,
and he clung to it desperately, not daring
to voice it until the end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The name,&rdquo; he said faintly, &ldquo;would
of course remain &lsquo;The Opp Eagle&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hinton dropped his eyes; he could
not stand the wistful appeal in the drawn
face opposite.</p>

<p><a name="png.316" id="png.316"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">311</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said shortly; &ldquo;that&#8217;s a&mdash;little
too personal. I think I should call
my paper &lsquo;The Weekly News.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Opp could never distinctly remember
what happened after that. He knew
that he had at first declined the offer,
that he had been argued with, had reconsidered,
and finally accepted a larger sum
than he had asked for; but the details of
the transaction were like the setting of
bones after an accident.</p>

<p>He remembered that he had sat where
Hinton left him, staring at the floor until
Nick came to close the office; then he
had a vague impression of crossing the
fields and standing with his head against
the old sycamore-tree where the birds
had once whispered of love. After that
he knew that he had met Hinton and
Guinevere coming up the river road
hand in hand, that he had gotten home
after supper was over, and had built a
bridge of blocks for Miss Kippy.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he had wakened to full
consciousness, staggered out of the house
to the woodshed, and shivered down into
<a name="png.317" id="png.317"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">312</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>a miserable heap. There in the darkness
he seemed to see things, for the first time
in his life, quite as they were. His gaze,
accustomed to the glittering promise of
the future, peered fearfully into the
past, and reviewed the long line of
groundless hopes, of empty projects, of
self-deceptions. Shorn of its petty
shams and deceits, and stripped of its
counterfeit armor of conceit, his life lay
naked before him, a pitiful, starved,
futile thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve just been similar to Kippy,&rdquo; he
sobbed, with his face in his hands, &ldquo;continually
pretending what wasn&#8217;t so. I
acted like I was young, and good-looking,
and&mdash;and highly educated; and look
at me! Look at me!&rdquo; he demanded
fiercely of the kindling-wood.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp had been fighting a long duel&mdash;a
duel with Circumstance, and Mr.
Opp was vanquished. The acknowledgment
of defeat, even to himself, gave it
the final stamp of verity. He had fought
valiantly, with what poor weapons he
had, but the thrusts had been too many
<a name="png.318" id="png.318"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">313</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and too sure. He lay clothed in his
strange new garment of humility, and
wondered why he did not want to die.
He did not realize that in losing everything
else, he had won the greater stake
of character for which he had been unconsciously
fighting all along.</p>

<p>The kitchen door opened, and he saw
Miss Kippy&#8217;s figure silhouetted against
the light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brother D.,&rdquo; she called impatiently,
&ldquo;ain&#8217;t you coming back to play with
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He scrambled to his feet and made a
hasty and somewhat guilty effort to compose
himself.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&ldquo;Yes, I&#8217;m a-coming,&rdquo; he answered
briskly, as he smoothed his scant locks
and straightened his tie. &ldquo;You go on
ahead and gather up the blocks; I only
stopped playing for a little spell.&rdquo;</p>

 </span>XVIII</h2>


<p class="start"><img class="initial" src="images/t-initial.png"
 alt="T" title="T" width="149" height="150" /><span>he</span> marriage of Guinevere
Gusty and Willard Hinton
took place in mid-winter,
and the account
of it, published in the
last issue of &ldquo;The Opp
Eagle,&rdquo; proved that the eagle, like the
swan, has its death-song.</p>

<p>Like many of the masterpieces of literature,
the article had been written in
anguish of spirit; but art, like nature,
ignores the process, and reckons only the
result, and the result, in Mr. Opp&#8217;s opinion
at least, more than justified the effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In these strenuous, history-making
meanderings of the sands of life,&rdquo; it
ran, &ldquo;we sometimes overlook or neglect
particulars in events which prove of
larger importance than appears on the
surface. The case to which we have
<a name="png.320" id="png.320"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">315</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>allusion to is the wedding which was solemnized
at eventide at the residence of
the bride&#8217;s mother. The Gustys may
be justly considered one of the best-furnished
families in the county, and the
parlors were only less beautiful than the
only daughter there presiding. The collation
served therein was of such a liberal
nature that every guest, we might
venture to say, took dinner enough home
for supper. It has seldom been our fate
to meet a gentleman of such intelligent
attainments as Mr. Hinton, and his entire
future existence, be it long or short,
cannot fail of being thrice blessed by
the companionship of the one who has
confided her trust to him,&mdash;her choice,
world-wide. Although a bachelor ourself,
we know what happiness must be
theirs, and with all our heart we vouchsafe
them a joyful voyage across the uncertain
billows of Time until their nuptial
or matrimonial bark shall have
been safely moored in the haven of everlasting
bliss, where the storms of this
life spread not their violence.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.321" id="png.321"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">316</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Some men spend their lives in the valley,
and some are born and die on the
heights; but it was Mr. Opp&#8217;s fate to
climb from the valley to his own little
mountain-top of prosperity, only to have
to climb down on the other side. It was
evidence of his genius that in time he
persuaded himself and his fellow-citizens
that it was exactly what he wanted
to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That there life of managing and promoting
was all right in its way,&rdquo; he said
one day to a group of men at the post-office,
&ldquo;but a man owes something to
himself, don&#8217;t he? Now that the town
has got well started, and Mr. Hinton is
going to take main charge of the paper,
I&#8217;ll be freer than I been for years to put
some of my ideas into practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are counting on getting you back
in the orchestra,&rdquo; said Mr. Gallop,
whose admiration for Mr. Opp retained
its pristine bloom.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp shook his head regretfully.
&ldquo;No, I&#8217;m going to give all my evenings
over to study. This present enterprise I
<a name="png.322" id="png.322"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">317</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>am engaged on requires a lot of personal
application. I sometimes think that I
have in the past scattered my forces too
much, in a way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So persistently did Mr. Opp refer to
the mysterious work that was engrossing
him that he reduced Mr. Gallop&#8217;s curiosity
to the saturation-point.</p>

<p>When he was no longer able to stand
it, the telegraph operator determined
upon a tour of investigation. The projected
presentation of a new cornet by
the Unique Orchestra to its erstwhile
leader proved a slender excuse for a call,
and while he knew that, with the exception
of Willard Hinton, no visitor had
ever been known to cross the Opp threshold,
yet he permitted desire to overrule
delicacy.</p>

<p>It was a blustery December night when
he climbed the hill, and he had to pause
several times during the ascent to gain
sufficient breath to proceed. By the time
he reached the house he was quite speechless,
and he dropped on the steps to rest
a moment before knocking. As he sat
<a name="png.323" id="png.323"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">318</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>there trying to imagine the flying-machine
or torpedo-boat upon which he
felt certain Mr. Opp was engaged, he
became aware of voices from within, and
looking up, he saw the window above him
was slightly raised. Overcome by his
desire to see his friend at work upon his
great invention, he cautiously tiptoed
across the porch and peeped in.</p>

<p>The low-ceilinged old room was bright
with firelight, and in the center of it, with
his knees drawn up, his toes turned in,
and his tongue thrust out, sat Mr. Opp,
absorbed in an object which he held between
his knees. Miss Kippy knelt before
him, eagerly watching proceedings.</p>

<p>Mr. Gallop craned his neck to see what
it was that held their interest, and at last
discovered that they were fitting a dress
on a large china doll.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">Miss Kippy&#8217;s voice broke the silence.
&ldquo;You can sew nice,&rdquo; she was saying;
&ldquo;you can sew prettier than Aunt Tish.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="illus pgbrk"><a name="png.324" id="png.324"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">319</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span><img src="images/illus324.jpg" width="450" height="720"
 alt="" title="" /><br
 />&ldquo;&lsquo;Can&#8217;t nobody beat me making skirts&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&#8217;t nobody beat me making
skirts,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, and Mr. Gallop
saw him push his needle through a bit of
<a name="png.326" id="png.326"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">321</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>cloth, with the handle of the shovel; &ldquo;but
sleeves is a more particular proposition.
Why, I&#8217;d rather thread three needles
than to fix in one sleeve! Why don&#8217;t you
make like it&#8217;s summer-time and let her
go without any?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Kippy&#8217;s lips trembled. &ldquo;I want
sleeves, D.&mdash;two of them, and a lady&#8217;s
hat, with roses on it. We can let <em>her</em> be
grown up, can&#8217;t we, D.?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Gallop beat a hasty and shame-faced
retreat. Though his idol had
fallen from its pedestal, he determined
to stand guard over the fragments, and
from that night on, he constituted himself
Mr. Opp&#8217;s loyal defender.</p>

<p>And Mr. Gallop was not the only one
who came forth boldly in expressions of
sympathy and respect for the ex-editor.
It was especially easy for those who had
prospered by the oil boom to express unbounded
admiration for the conscientious
stand he had taken in the late
transaction. They had done him a grave
injustice, they acknowledged. The wells
had been reinvestigated and proved of
<a name="png.327" id="png.327"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">322</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>small value. The fact that the truth was
discovered too late to affect their luck
deepened their appreciation of Mr. Opp.</p>

<p>Willard Hinton, seeing what balm
these evidences of approval brought to
Mr. Opp&#8217;s wounded spirit, determined
to arrange for a banquet to the retiring
editor, at which he planned to bring
forth as many testimonials of friendship
and good-will as was possible.</p>

<p>The affair was to take place New
Year&#8217;s night, in the dining-room of Fallows&#8217;s
new Your Hotel. The entire masculine
contingent of the Cove was
invited, and the feminine element prepared
the supper. There had never been
a social event of such an ambitious
nature attempted in the Cove before, and
each citizen took a personal pride in its
success.</p>

<p>For a week in advance the town was
in violent throes of speech-writing, cake-baking,
salad-mixing, and decorating.
Even Mrs. Fallows warmed to the occasion,
and crocheted a candlestick, candle,
flame, and all, to grace the table.</p>

<p><a name="png.328" id="png.328"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">323</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>When the night arrived, Jimmy Fallows
did the honors. He was resplendent
in his dress-suit, which consisted of a
black sateen shirt and a brown suit of
clothes.</p>

<p>When the guests were all seated, Willard
Hinton rose, and in a few brief,
pointed remarks, called the attention of
the town to the changes that had been
wrought by the indefatigable efforts of
one citizen in particular. He spoke of
the debt of gratitude they owed, collectively
and individually, to the late editor
of &ldquo;The Opp Eagle,&rdquo; and added that
after Mr. Opp&#8217;s response, the guests desired,
each in turn, to voice his sentiments
upon the subject.</p>

<p>Mr. Opp then rose amid a thunder of
applause, and stood for a moment in
pleased but overwhelming embarrassment.
Then he put forward one foot
inflated his chest, and began:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Valued brother fellow-beings, I come
before you to-night to express that which
there is no words in the English vocabulary
to express. Whatever you may
<a name="png.329" id="png.329"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">324</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>have to say concerning me, or my part
in the awakening of this our native city,
I shall listen at with a grateful heart. I
believe in a great future for Cove City.
We may not live to see it, but I believe
that the day will arrive when our city
shall be the gateway to the South, when
the river front will be not dissimilar to
Main Street, New York. I predict that
it reaches a pivot of prominence of which
we wot not of. As for Mr. Hinton, one
and all we welcome him amid our
mongst. &lsquo;The Opp Eagle&rsquo; strikes palms
with &lsquo;The Weekly News,&rsquo; and wishes it
a lasting and eternal success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A burst of applause interrupted the
flow of his eloquence, and as he glanced
around the room, he saw there was some
commotion at the door. A turbaned
head caught his eye, then Aunt Tish&#8217;s
beckoning hand.</p>

<p>Hastily excusing himself, he made his
way through the crowd, and bent to hear
her message.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hit&#8217;s Miss Kippy,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;I hate to &#8217;sturb you, but she done crack
<a name="png.330" id="png.330"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">325</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>her doll&#8217;s head, an&#8217; she&#8217;s takin&#8217; on so, I
can&#8217;t do nuffin &#8217;t all wif her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn&#8217;t you contrive to get her
quiet no way at all?&rdquo; asked Mr. Opp,
anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw, sir. She mek like dat doll her
shore &#8217;nough baby, and she &#8217;low she
gwine die, too, furst chanct she gits. I
got Val&#8217;s mother to stay wif her till I
git back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Mr. Opp, hastily.
&ldquo;You go right on and tell her I&#8217;m coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he reëntered the dining-room,
he held his hat in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I find a urgent matter of business
calls me back home; for only a few moments,
I trust,&rdquo; he said apologetically,
with bows and smiles. &ldquo;If the banquet
will kindly proceed, I will endeavor to
return in ample time for the final
speeches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the air of a monarch taking temporary
leave of his subjects, he turned
his back upon the gay, protesting crowd,
upon the feast prepared in his honor,
<a name="png.331" id="png.331"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">326</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>upon the speech-making, so dear to his
heart. Tramping through the snow of
the deserted street, through the lonely
graveyard, and along the river road, he
went to bind up the head of a china doll,
and to wipe away the tears of a little
half-crazed sister.</p>

<p>He wears the same checked suit as
when we saw him first, worn and frayed,
to be sure, but carefully pressed for the
occasion, the same brave scarf and pin,
and watch fob, though the watch is missing.</p>

<p>Passing out of sight with the sleet in
his face, and the wind cutting through
his finery, he whistles as he goes, such a
plucky, sturdy, hopeful whistle as calls
to arms the courage that lies slumbering
in the hearts of men.</p>
